5. Around 6:01 am, after about 100 times refreshing the page, you’ll be taken to the log in page. Hooray. 

6. Enter your location and suburb, enter your username and password [yes, you need to be registered] and try to log in. If you’re lucky, you’ll be taken to the products page. If you’ve been naughty, you’ll get an error message requiring you to repeat the log-in process. 

7. You’re now on the products page. You may note that they don’t have a whole lot of stuff available. You’re so happy you have logged in however that this is not likely to disappoint you too much, even if you notice it. 

8. Pay attention to the number at the top righthand corner of the page, which is the number of available orders. This number keeps going down as more and more people place orders. The rate at which this number keeps going down during your ordering process is alarming and is reminiscent of the way in which the number of covid19 patients keeps going up. Concentrate on the task at hand.

9. Start adding the stuff you need to your cart. Due to the fact that Keells likes you and wants to keep you on their site for as long as possible, the adding to the cart process is wonderfully slow paced. Don’t move on to another product till you see the first product in your card. Likewise, don’t try to modify the quantity once you’ve added a product to your cart. This is likely to confuse the website. When the website gets confused, it gets angry. It takes that anger out on you. It does this by taking you to a blank page saying ‘the page is not available’ or some shit like that. Do not make the website angry. 

10. Once you’ve got all your shit in your cart, proceed to check out. If you think you’re almost done, think again. Now’s the time for that second cup of coffee. And a prayer. 

11. Select payment option and proceed. Instead of taking you to the payment page, you’ll be taken to the very first page asking for you to select your location. Try not to dash your laptop on the ground. Instead, click on check out again and repeat the process. Do this about 150 times. Remember, the retailer loves you and is just playing with you. Indulge it. 

12. At some point of this cycle, you’ll be taken to a pop-up which asks you to agree with certain terms and conditions. As you have done all your life, click on ‘I agree’ without reading the said terms. Anyway, after having spent the better part of the morning on the website you’re not likely to click on ‘I don’t agree’.

13. If you are a mortal like me, you’ll then get an error message asking you to call or text the hotline number. Just for the fun of it, you will try calling only to get a message indicating that their offices are not yet open. Keep clicking on check-out and repeat the process. 

14. After about another 150 repeats, you’ll get a message saying that your session’s timed out. Joy. 

15. Just for the heck of it, check the number on the top righthand of the screen. In the hour you’ve been trying to complete your order, 800 other people have already placed their orders. What. The. Actual. Fuck. 

16. Go through the mandatory series of expletives – WHAT THE FUCK KEELLS?; YOU’VE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!; FUCK, I CAN’T DO THIS ANYMORE, I’D RATHER STARVE; FUCK YOU, KEELLS etc. 

17. At this stage, if you’ve not yet suffered a nervous breakdown or heart attack, not been reduced to a wailing, sorry excuse for a human, and not trashed your expensive laptop, take a deep breath, log-off, log-in again and repeat the entire process, except do it slower this time. 

18. About an hour and a bit after you first sat in front of your computer, if you’re lucky, you’ll finally be taken to the bank payment page and you can complete your order. At this point, if you and your computer have survived the ordeal, you’ll just break down in tears. 

19. Wake up the wife and tell her that your conquered the Keells Online Challenge. She will congratulate you and go back to sleep.
