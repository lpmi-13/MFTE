Whoever made this “Emo Christmas Bangers” playlist on Spotify deserves a beautiful trophy.


My husband thought a picture of my 18-year-old mom on my aunt’s fridge was me, and I don’t know how to feel about it because he thinks I’m hot and?????


@BadgerPharm37 My sister’s 😭😭


@10iskristin They are definitely a family favorite.

How does one dance and prance in jingle bell square. What is a jingle horse.


@EveLynne42 We usually only do rollouts, and my aunt does the other ones. We wanted to make sure she didn’t have to because she is in remission. :)


Came home to this excessively nice holiday gift from my work. I love flowers and cheese. https://t.co/OdgEsId0Lj

@librarymaureen @Selective_Kate This is so pretty.


I have nothing to complain about today. All is well.


My sister made me come over to her house at 10:00 am to start Christmas baking, and I’m just not a person yet.


Happy Capricorn season to those who celebrate. https://t.co/55ikBem2Xm


@ConwayTweeter6 What a cool guy. 🙃


@deestweets23 Happy birthday, Dee! I hope it’s amazing. You deserve it.


Goodnight, Bean. https://t.co/QLh1RhtiTJ


@LandmarkMKE “I can’t see your smile.”

Good.


The fruits of our labor. Merry holiday times! https://t.co/H2rzVPzb4e


Wearing a mask in public is the absolute minimal amount you can do for public health right now. It isn’t hard. It’s barely an inconvenience. The reason most people aren’t wearing one is simply because they are assholes.


Happy birthday to fellow Capricorn and cool dude @Leonard42. 🥳


@scuriiosa Merry Christmas, friend!! ❤️


Merry Christmas III! The one with the most dogs. https://t.co/RoUtncHUaP

@lincolngoogle Good!


@lincolngoogle The good news is I get to see my family tomorrow, and they like me a lot!


@the_krmrjohnson By my work I just mean everything I do in general. Not my day job. 🥲


@Billy_dk_89 Thanks, Bill! Merry Christmas. 🎄


@pelliepellie81 I am sorry it’s hard for her too. :(


My in-laws? Not big fans of my work.


Shout out to all my people who have strained relationships with their in-laws. It’s awkward and can make for anxious holiday times.


@MountainQueen27 They are my turtles-in-law. :(

@scuriiosa @stevekniss Goodbye, my friends.


@sarahspooon Happy birthday to this precious angel!!


This is the first Christmas ever I have not seen my parents, and I sort of hate it honestly.


@scuriiosa Would?? I WILL do it.


I just had the best sleep I’ve had all year. Eight unbroken hours. Merry Christmas to me.


Merry Christmas from the boys. https://t.co/7bJq77R6pX


@mjames323 Congrats!!


@3GamesToLove I am sorry you are dealing with this too.


@walkingtall100 I respect Poco’s avoidance.

I somehow found the best possible husband, and I’m thankful every day to have someone who loves how much of a weirdo I am and who offers so much support.

@Keelin_12ft He loves his only child.


@COgirlWIworld He is a sweetie pie and would never have done that awake. He loves friends. :)


@mjames323 We love da Bean!


Bean woke up from a bad dream and bit my face (startle reflex). My nose is a little messed up, but we will both be okay!! 

We are going to get Bean some anxiety meds and startle training with a behaviorist. He is such a scaredy boy. 🥺🥺


@deestweets23 My stepson’s birthday is ON Christmas, so I’ll never complain.


@deestweets23 As a fellow December birthday, I mostly forget about my birthday.


Going to buy a zoo pass and work from the otter palace.


@mjames323 Toyota or Subaru. Toyotas are cheaper to fix and last an amazingly long time. The perk for Subarus is that all of them have AWD, and I’m a fangirl because of how they look.


@goldgiraffes I do like Michigan.


Fuck Kellogg’s. They’d rather pay to remove logos than help their workers. Absolute garbage company. (Glad they’re clearly feeling the boycott, though. Let’s go!) https://t.co/S2qIfrb8UH


@the_krmrjohnson I am back at OrangeTheory for now, but I’d like to still supplement with the hike 2-3 times per week. Trying to get into that habit. 🥳


@the_krmrjohnson This was in reference to the recent Peloton media drama. Not a great week for them haha.


My New Years resolution is giving up Door Dash and forcing myself to get my own food if I don’t want to eat what I have at home. I was awful this year.


@RodgersPackMVP Feel better soon, Lambeau! I love you.


@WIbeerbaron I was not! Was there a super cool seeming person who looks like me? 🥲


@WillieP_WSox He is so cool. 😭


You can’t be condescending to someone catching COVID right now. We’re all getting Omicron for the holidays.


@goldgiraffes Maybe you had a bundtlet and not a bundtini? The bundtinis are tiny — one or two bites. 

(I know too much about this place.)


Poco is the worst emotional support animal. If you cry or even hint at crying, she will abandon you for an emotionally stable person or empty room. 🥲 https://t.co/PYgQFdtENU


Officially three years of “trying” to have a baby and three years of nothing. It’s hard. I’m sad and tired and don’t want to Christmas.


@rojopalko Navi said her last HEY LISTEN :(


@sarahkehoe That sucks, Sarah. Feel better soon. ❤️

@alysaz23 @mkeadmirals We will try to go to this one!


@WizzKhaleesi Hell yeah LET’S GO


@siliconred This is so weird and silly. Barrett didn’t have his card when he went, so they just gave him the info. He then added it when he got home. Sorry you dealt with this!


@dysthymikey I am so sorry, Mikey. Please let me know if I can do anything for you. Pets are family.


@WizzKhaleesi Pick the middle one


@goldgiraffes 600 AMAZING calories and breakfast of champs.


We brought baby Smuckers home a year ago. An excellent decision by all

Americans should be pissed that their government likes and protects the places they work more than them tbh


@Roxy__Virginia Go off! This is the most sustainable way to lose weight because you don’t have to deprive yourself of anything. 

I think one of my struggles is just figuring out what my TDEE is while also exercising because you also want to make sure you’re eating enough.


@pdubsRN I need to get back to those! I was a little disconnected from my hobbies this year. :)


When my car was stolen, the cops accused me of getting drunk, driving my car, and abandoning it somewhere. They made so many assumptions about me, and it was a really humiliating experience. (I don’t even drink.) https://t.co/kdsn3k6RXj

It’s my Diet Coke fridge. https://t.co/II1RQd9KiW


I watched Don’t Look Up last night and thought it was decent and entertaining. The main theme was heavy-handed, but there were some really good scenes (eg: the dinner scene at the end). 

Overall, an okay movie that I wouldn’t tell someone not to watch.


@Soxfan351479 Fever and body aches that started 12 hours after the shot and lasted about 24 hours. I took a fever reducer and slept and felt 100% the next day.
