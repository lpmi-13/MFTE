Hi,
 
Would they prefer me to bring it in as a physical CD or to just to send you a folder with the contents via email?

Hi,

Just wanted to let you know that I have sent off my scholarship application now and it's been received. I sent my dissertation to the binders in County and they say it should be ready for Monday so I can hand it in then. It's so weird to be finally finished?

But thank you so much for all of your help and advice and for being a great supervisor!!! :)

Hi,

Just e-mailing to confirm some things about this Thursday. I know you are striking this Thursday so obviously you won't be there. Do you still want me to message you at the end of the day and let you know what I have done?

Thanks,

Hi,
I'm pretty much finished my dissertation now so I'm just working on my Appendix and I have a question about anonymity.
 
All tweets screenshotted and directly referenced in the text itself have been fully anonymised, including when they mention users who are not participants. However in my appendix I'm including a list of all tweets so I'm making everyone mentioned anonymous with the exception of verified accounts, authors etc but I'm not sure about viral tweets. For example one participant retweeted something which got 4000 retweets so I'm not sure whether to make their handle anonymous or not? What do you think?
 
 
Thank you,

Hi, 
I have lost my bus pass and tried everywhere looking for it. It has not turned up at the bus station either, so I need a replacement. 
I have a photo with the digits on the back. 
Also, my student ID (library card) was with it. Do you know where I can get a replacement? 
Thank you very much,

Hi, 
Yes I tried the security Lodge yesterday afternoon and they said if it turned up they would email me anyway because it has my library card with it so. 
Would you be able to cancel it for me? 
Thank you very much

Hi,

For some reason  when I came back from lunch my computer decided to stop playing all sound so I can't listen to any of the files. It says my headphones aren't plugged in when they are and it won't play any sound from the speaker when I unplug them. This happens with all sounds, not just Audacity - I tried playing something on YouTube and there was no sound there either.  I tried restarting the computer and it still won't work.
