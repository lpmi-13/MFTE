FLIGHT FUMES DANGER

HOLIDAYMAKERS have been warned of the toxic fumes they breathe every time they
take a flight.

A new study found flight attendants have made dozens of complaints about the
"fume events" with chemicals found in blood and urine samples.

The research adds to fears aero-toxic syndrome may be causing sickness Cabin
crew and frequent fliers affected by the dangerous chemicals have complained of
symptoms such as asthma, eye and nose issues, feeling sick, headaches, numbness
in the feet and memory problems.

Documents from the Civil Aviation Authority showed that there were 251 separate
incidents of fumes or smoke inside a large passenger jet operated by British air
carriers between April 2014 and May 2015.

Illness was reported in 104 cases, and on 28 flights oxygen was used.

The Unite union, whose members include 20,000 flight crew, is representing 60
crew who allege that they are suffering aero-toxic syndrome as a result of
flying.
