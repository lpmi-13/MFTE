Why cats really get depressed

Today's cats are depressed, by all accounts, and no one knows why, although it
may be because they've finally realised they are not dogs.

I think if I were a cat and realised I wasn't a dog I'd be depressed. "Hang on",
I'd say, "you go away for the weekend and you make all sorts of complicated
arrangements for the dog, or take the dog with you, but me? You Just bung out a
load of Whiskas and hope for the best? Man, it sucks, not being a dog."

Or I'd say: "I've never helped a blind person cross the road or contributed to
the language, as no one is ever cat-tired or adopts a hang-cat expression or
chases away the night before with the hair of the cat. My life is meaningless. I
am of no use to anybody. My poo isn't even worth picking up. I'm nothing. Might
as well end it now." I can't think of much to cheer cats up, although a tight
space has yet to be described as too small to swing a dog. So there is that.
