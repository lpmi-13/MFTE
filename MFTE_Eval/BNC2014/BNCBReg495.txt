Stay safe online
	

EVERY parent knows that keeping their children safe online can be a daunting and
challenging task. It's never more important than in the school holidays and this
years summer break in Gwent is already being dominated by a huge new arrival.
Pokémon Go is setting precedent as one of the most successful reality game apps
on the market, which makes it even more disappointing that child safety is
simply not at its heart. The apps owners have ignored many warning signs and
well-documented concerns. It would've been far better if more safety measures
had been put in place and we've developed a guide on the game for parents, which
is available on our website. Pokémon Go is just the latest drop in an
ever-expanding digital ocean and while the online world can provide vast
benefits for children, its not without clear risks. Last year, online abuse and
safety issues accounted for more than 1,500 calls to Wales two ChildLine bases.
We believe social networking sites must be held to account for their content and
in Wales, there's also a real opportunity for ministers to lead the way and
introduce a comprehensive online safety plan. The internet's an invaluable
resource but an undeniable challenge and nspcc.org.uk has a range of advice and
tips for children and parents.
