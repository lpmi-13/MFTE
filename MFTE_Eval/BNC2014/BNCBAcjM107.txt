Group psychological intervention for postnatal depression: a nested qualitative study with British South Asian women



Background: Postnatal depression affects 10 - 15 % of all mothers in Western societies and remains a major public
health concern for women from diverse cultures. British Pakistani and Indian women have a higher prevalence of
depression in comparison to their white counterparts. Research has shown that culturally adapted interventions
using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) may be acceptable and may help to address the needs of this population.
The aim of this study was to assess the acceptability and overall experience of the Positive Health Programme by
British South Asian mothers.

Methods: This was a nested qualitative study, part of an exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted
to test the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally - adapted intervention (Positive Health Programme or PHP) for
postnatal depression in British South Asian women. In - depth interviews (N = 17) were conducted to determine the
views of the participants on the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.

Results: The participants found the intervention acceptable and experienced an overall positive change in their
attitudes, behaviour, and increased self - confidence.

Conclusions: The findings suggest that the culturally adapted Positive Health Programme is acceptable to British
South Asian women. These results support that culturally sensitive interventions may lead to better health outcomes
and overall satisfaction.

Background
Postnatal depression affects approximately 8.5 - 11.0 % of
all mothers in Western societies [1, 2]. The prevalence
of perinatal depression is higher among mothers from
certain ethnic minority groups [3]. This indicates ethnicity to be a significant risk factor for developing postnatal depression. Ethnicity has also been reported to be
linked to poor health outcomes for both ethnic minority
mothers and their infants, as reflected in higher rates of

infant and maternal mortality and morbidity and lower
birth - weight [4]. Part of this risk lies in the interaction of
economic disadvantage with ethnic minority grouping.
Postnatal depression is a treatable disorder [5]. Antidepressants are effective, but new mothers are reluctant to
take such medications whilst nursing [6]. Among psychotherapeutic interventions, Interpersonal Psychotherapy
(IPT) and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) have
shown the most efficacy in the treatment of postnatal
depression [6 - 8]. With regard to the postnatal treatment
of British ethnic minority women, the National Institute of
Clinical Excellence (NICE) [9] 2007 guidelines recommend that they should be provided with culturally sensitive information and treatment. However, we know from
our earlier work [10, 11] that several barriers prevent



access to appropriate mental health services for British
South Asian women. Even where help is accessible it is
not sensitive to the cultural needs of this population.
British South Asian women have higher birth rates compared to the majority white population and are considered
'difficult to reach' due to language and cultural barriers.
Research [12, 13] indicates that British Pakistani women
have high rates of postnatal depression, lack social support,
experience interpersonal relationship problems [12] and
linguistic and cultural barriers in accessing services [14].
Isolation and lack of social support are therefore important
elements to be addressed in interventions. There is, however, little empirical evidence addressing the adaptation of
evidence - based interventions to ensure their applicability
to specific ethnic communities [15 - 18]. Recent studies
evaluating a culturally - sensitive psychosocial group intervention for the treatment of depression in British Pakistani
women reported an improvement in participants' selfconfidence at the end of the intervention [11, 19]. Overall,
the findings indicated that social groups which had taken
into consideration the sociocultural needs of British
Pakistani women experiencing depression were acceptable
to them.
Despite the above research, there is a clear gap in

evidence for informing culturally - sensitive interventions for maternal depression in British South Asian
women [18 - 20]. This paper provides a qualitative
evaluation of a psychosocial intervention called the
Positive Health Programme (PHP), which was adapted for
and offered to British South Asian women experiencing
postnatal depression. The programme was designed to be
delivered to groups of participants using the cognitive
behavioural model [21]. The manual assisted programme,
tailored to the cultural needs of British Pakistani women,
was developed by our group and initially feasibility tested
for a PhD project [22]. It consisted of 12 weekly group
sessions delivered over 3 months. The manual is organized
into 9 distinct sections.

The main trial
This paper describes the results of a post - intervention
qualitative study as part of an exploratory randomized
controlled trial conducted to test the feasibility and
acceptability of a culturally - adapted intervention (Positive
Health Programme or PHP) for postnatal depression in
British South Asian women. The study was carried out
across Manchester and Lancashire (UK). The recruitment
(N = 615) and trial retention figures (70 %) highlight the
ability of the research team to engage with this population.
In the intention - to - treat analysis there was no significant
difference between intervention and control groups for
any of the depression scores at either follow - up. Following
the initial analysis, another analysis was carried out based
on attendance to the intervention. Completers were defined

as those participants who had attended 4 or more sessions.
Fifteen of the 42 patients in the intervention group did not
attend any of the therapy sessions, while the remaining 27
patients attended at least 4 sessions. Overall, the mean
number of sessions attended was 6.6 (SD = 5.2). The
Spearman's correlation coefficient between the number of
sessions attended and reduction in the Hamilton score
from baseline to follow - up 1 was 0.35 (p = 0.048), with
greater reductions in the Hamilton score being associated
with more sessions attended. Correlations between changes
from baseline to follow - ups in the other variables ranged
from - 0.20 for EPDS at the second follow - up.
This paper describes the qualitative phase of the trial

and explores the participants' experiences of receiving
the PHP.

Aims
To assess the acceptability and overall experience of the
Positive Health Programme by British South Asian
mothers.

Objectives

1. To identify the barriers faced by the British South
Asian women in accessing the intervention.

2. To identify factors which facilitated participants'
engagement with the PHP.

Methods
This study aims to explore a wide range of views and
experiences of British South Asian women which quantitative methods do not often allow to be explored in detail
[23]. In contrast, qualitative methods for data collection
are sensitive to the unique personal experiences, perceptions, beliefs, and meanings related to individuals and
therefore believed to be the most appropriate method to
be employed within this study [24]. Qualitative analysis
also offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach
to analysing qualitative data [24]. One of the strengths of
this approach is that it enables the researcher to focus on
identifying themes and patterns of behaviours [25].

Recruitment
A total of 83 women with a confirmed diagnosis of depression using the Clinical Interview Schedule - Revised (CISR)
interview [26] took part in the RCT. These women were of
South Asian origin as defined by the Office of National
Statistics (ONS) (ONS is the recognised national statistical
institute for the UK providing official statistics), over the
age of 16 years, and living with their babies. The PHP
programme was offered to 42 British South Asian women
who were randomly allocated to the intervention arm of
the randomised controlled trial (RCT). The women were
recruited between 2012 and 2013 from multiple sites in



Manchester and Lancashire, including General Practices
and Children Centres, and were organised into 4 groups
for evaluation of the PHP. The programme was delivered
at the local Sure Start children's centre over a 12 - week
period by trained research staff. Of the 42 women who
were randomised to the PHP group intervention, 20 were
randomly selected using the random number tables and
were invited for qualitative interviews. A total of 20
women were contacted for obtaining informed consent,
17 agreed to take part, whilst three could not be
contacted. Five of the participating women were from the
Manchester intervention group and the remaining 12 were
from the Lancashire intervention group. The interviews
took place at the participants' homes as most did not have
access to alternative child care arrangements.

Procedure
In - depth interviews were conducted with the participants
using a topic guide. The topic guide for this study was
developed and informed by both existing literature in this
area and an earlier feasibility study [22]. The key areas
explored were reasons for participation, barriers to receiving the intervention, and perception of the intervention
process including participants' initial expectations and
reflections. The interviews explored participants' views on
how the PHP sessions took place, the format and frequency of the sessions, the characteristics of the facilitator,
the use of handouts and other session materials, and the
acceptability of the delivery of the intervention. Each
interview lasted approximately 45 min and was conducted
in the participant's preferred language; all the interviews
were carried out in the Urdu language. Later these interviews were translated into English. The analysis and
coding process was also carried out in English.

Ethics approval
The study was approved by the North West Research
Ethics Committee (10/H1005/62).

Analysis
Interviews were transcribed verbatim, anonymised, and
analysed using thematic analysis [27]. Thematic analysis
is a flexible approach where, in contrast to other qualitative methods, the researcher is attached to a theoretical
framework [28]. Thematic analysis is appropriate for use
in a multi - method context where the qualitative element
of enquiry is framed by prior work consistent with the
present study which is embedded in a larger randomised
controlled trial. The complete interview recordings were
listened to and the corresponding transcripts were read
over multiple times for familiarization [29]. A code book
was maintained to keep the process of coding systematic
and intact. Specific events, thoughts, and actions were
coded or identified as themes on the basis of their ability

to "capture something important in relation to the
overall research question" ([27], p.82) by the researcher,
YM. The researcher did not try to fit the codes into
existing code frameworks. The coding process aimed to
identify themes that were internally homogenous, externally homogenous, and had explanatory power. This
involved an iterative process comparing themes against
transcript data in order to ensure that the emerging
structure of themes continued to be grounded only in
the data set. Ultimately, the data collection process
ended due to thematic saturation (where no additional
themes were achieved) [28]. Participants' responses were
first analysed on a semantic level, whilst the main
themes were developed at the second stage, involving
latent analysis of how coherently and adequately the
themes represented the meaning of the data as a whole
[27]. Themes and sub - themes were reviewed between
the researcher (YM) and the supervisor (KL) before the
analysis was finalized.

Results
A total of 17 women took part in the qualitative interviews;
the age range was 20 - 45 years. The sample characteristics
are described in Table 1.

Motivators to participate in the Positive Health
Programme (PHP)
Most of the women stated overcoming depression through
a better understanding of their mental health issues, enhancing their confidence, meeting other women in similar




situations, and sharing experiences as the major motivating
factors for participation in the programme.

Yes, definitely! I wanted to come out of depression and
wanted to meet new people because to me loneliness
was the main reason of my depression. And to me, if
there are other women who are lonely, they should
meet up and join these groups. Because of these you get
to know about other people and their situations. (ID 3)

Barriers to attendance and commitment
The sessions were held during the mornings which most
participants found convenient since it did not impact
their daily chores. Furthermore they had the support of
their family members.

No, there was no issues, no problems. My husband is
really supportive and he allowed me to go and join
these groups. (ID 3)

However, a few participants mentioned restrictions
from their husbands because they could not comprehend the need for the intervention. At times the husbands were not informed about the sessions or were not
told of the nature of the sessions for fear they would not
allow the participants to attend.

My husband did not want me to go; he did not let me
go anywhere. I had to look after my children, but he
just wanted me to sit with him and talk to him. (ID 2)

My husband didn't know that I was going to these
classes. I used to be home before he came back from
his work. (ID 9)

The participants considered the absence of childcare
arrangements as a potential barrier to attending the
sessions.

And we were offered a crèche facility; I used to take
him there; otherwise it would have been really
difficult for me. (ID 13)

Most of the participants did not drive and relied on
family members for transport arrangements to and
from the centre. Having transport expenses paid by
the programme was appreciated by all the participants because it reduced the burden of transportation
expenses on the participants.

Yes, there was the issue of travelling. I cannot drive
and my husband was admitted to the hospital. But
then they said they would pay me, so I continued with
the classes. (ID 1)

Most of the participants reported difficulty in completing the between - session work due to excessive domestic
responsibilities. However, all participants did realise that
between - session work was important for improving their
psychosocial well - being.

The homework was useful but my children were
young and I couldn't do that much. I tried but I could
not do that much. (ID 11)

Understanding of cultural and linguistic needs
Group facilitators conducting the sessions were of South
Asian origin which enabled them to communicate in the
participants' first language (Urdu) resulting in increased
group engagement and participation.

She spoke in Urdu and I had no problems. If she had
spoken in English then I might have had some
problems and I would have not even attended. (ID 3)

Some of the participants expressed concerns over not
being able to read the handouts due to lack of English
reading skills. This resulted in their dependence on other
group members and facilitators to understand the handout content. It was suggested that the handouts be
translated into the participants' first language to make
them useful for the readers.

For me it was ok. I did not have any problem; but I
feel for women who could not read English handouts
need to be written in Urdu. These women felt that
they were depending on us or the facilitator for
guidance. (ID 4)

The participants appreciated the facilitator's knowledge
and understanding of their socio - cultural dynamics which
enabled the facilitators to relate to the participating
women's culturally specific issues and address them in the
sessions sensitively.

Because she understood what we go through, how our
culture is, and how our belief systems are. She could
understand us better than anyone else. (ID 5)

Most importantly, facilitators' skills such as the ability to
listen and empathise, encouraging and non - judgemental
attitude were recognized as important, facilitating open
and honest discussions within the groups.

...the main thing is that she listened to all of us.
There were times that we did not want to talk and we
were shy or hesitant; but she was very encouraging.
She made us feel that it is ok and we can open up.
She gave me the courage to speak openly about my



feelings. She appreciated us all to be more involved
and this made us open and be more communicative
to others. (ID12)

Participation in group sessions
A group - based intervention was appreciated and supported by nearly all the participants. They felt that the
group allowed them to share information, and understand
and explore solutions to their problems from each other's
perspectives. The mothers felt that the group was the only
platform where they had an opportunity to express their
emotions and feelings in a safe environment and this is
something they are often not able to do with their own
families.

... the best thing was I did not know anyone;.
Sometimes you don't want to discuss your personal
matters with people you know. (ID13)

However, some participants felt reluctant to disclose
personal issues in group settings due to fear of breach of
confidentiality. It was suggested by some of the participants to incorporate some individual sessions in between
group sessions.

In individual sessions, one can talk about problems
which can't be discussed in a group. And for groups
we can share and learn from each other. (ID12)

Open discussions were nonetheless much favoured
within the group as these offered flexibility along with
giving the opportunity to practise assertiveness skills
they had acquired during the sessions. Some participants
preferred storytelling activities, which allowed them to
talk about issues and explore solutions indirectly, without attracting attention.

I think open discussion was good and felt discussions
helped in overcoming my anxieties and shyness. To
me, these open discussions gave me the confidence to
interact and overcome my depression. (ID8)

Feeling confident and empowered
All the sessions were found useful by the participants as
they reported overall improved wellbeing. They felt better
able to deal with their day - to - day tasks. They also reported
enhanced self - esteem, being more proactive, and being
able to manage stress more effectively. They also spoke
about embracing and adopting a positive view of life.

I am more relaxed and confident. Earlier, I could not
speak and even go out of my house; now I go out with
my friends and feel that I can learn new things as
well. (ID6)

Learning positive thinking strategies and coping skills,
along with group participation and a good relationship
with the facilitator were reported as the most important
factors for facilitating change.

Um...it's the classes and the therapist. My life
segments are still there but I have changed my
thought process. I have a coping strategy for my
problems. (ID10)

Most of the women reported being able to manage
their everyday life more easily than before. The overall
change was noted when dealing with children, family
members, and oneself. Coping skills incorporated
techniques for stress and time management as well as
relaxation techniques.

Yes, it has. I am managing my family with less stress;
I have realized and have gained the knowledge of
overcoming my tension when I am dealing with my
children and husband. I tell them I can do only so
much at a time and they shouldn't be expecting a lot
from me. (ID2)

Suggestions for improvement
A majority of the participants highlighted the need for
such interventions to be ongoing as according to them
psychosocial problems are deep - rooted and require
much longer interventions.

Well, because it takes time to recover and then I
might encounter some more issues in my life for
which I might need guidance and assistance. You
know, we are alone here; there is no one with whom
to share and discuss our issues. (ID6)

Some participants suggested follow - up or 'top - up'
sessions to motivate them to continue using the strategies learnt in the sessions and also as an opportunity
to discuss additional issues and concerns with the
facilitator.

Well, I thought the sessions went by too quickly and
12 weeks were not enough. I would have liked more
sessions later because if something was missed or
someone did not pick up something, at least they
could have gone back and asked. (ID14)

One of the participants indicated health professionals'
lack of awareness of issues specific to ethnic minority
communities and suggested that professionals such as
GPs and nurse practitioners should be given culturespecific training.



Yes, what happened was, when I went to see my
nurse um...they did not give me any direction where
to go. I think GPs should be more involved, but these
sessions were really good. (ID13)

Discussion
The findings of our study highlight the experiences and
acceptability of a culturally - adapted intervention (PHP)
by British South Asian women. The main reasons for
participants to engage and participate in the PHP were
to gain support and to improve their self esteem and
well - being. These findings are in line with the Villegas &
McKay [30] study where low self - esteem has been
reported as a risk factor for developing postnatal depression. The perception of the group as a way of getting
social support by most of the participants is consistent
with the findings from a US - based study reporting
women who continued to be depressed two years after
giving birth as more likely to lack social support [31].
The participants in our study reported feeling positive

after the PHP intervention, although some faced barriers
from the family. A key factor in retaining women in the
PHP intervention was engaging with their family members, which facilitated their attendance at the sessions. A
study with Pakistani women with postnatal depression living in Pakistan [32] reported that the intervention, while
focusing on the mother and the infant, should also involve
other members of the family for the mother to receive
continued support so that she is able to engage with the
intervention. An earlier study with British Pakistani
women [10] reported that a major hindrance to social
group participation was resistance from family members,
particularly husbands.
A factor that helped with participation was the availability of free childcare to the participants at the intervention
venue. In addition, some of the participants had older
children; therefore, intervention sessions took place during
term times. The Reay et al. [33] pilot study of group interpersonal psychotherapy for postnatal depression and
research in the US [34] consider these to be key factors in
improving engagement, particularly with hard - to - reach
communities. Addressing transport arrangements was also
reported to be an important factor in this study. The findings are also supported by Crockett et al.'s [35] study
where lack of transport was found to be a barrier and
women reported facing obstacles in getting transportation
to the sessions. Chaudhry et al. [11] and later Gater et al.
[17] also reported that provision of transport was an absolute necessity to ensure attendance to the intervention
sessions by participants.
Furthermore, other difficulties raised by some participants were the inability to read and understand handouts
written in English and the carrying out of between - session
work due to personal and domestic commitments. There

were, therefore, suggestions to add material in Urdu along
with English, and some participants reported that completing the between - session work at home was not always
a practical option for them due to time constraints. This
needs to be considered in future research.
All the participants experienced an overall positive

change in their attitudes, behaviours, and confidence. This
positive change was attributed to a combination of facilitator input and coping strategies acquired over the 12
weekly sessions. The role of the facilitator was appreciated
highly and the participants found the facilitator to be
culturally aware and appropriately trained. The facilitator
was open and communicative and this enhanced the overall process and led to increased positivity in the participants. Rahman [32] states that an understanding of the
sociocultural context is essential for culturally - adapted interventions. In Rahman's [32] study the community health
workers were from the same community as the women,
and understood the sociocultural context of the women's
problems which was found to improve engagement.
Because the PHP intervention was group - based, all the

participants found factors such as sharing information,
relating problems with each other, and gaining from the
experiences of others helpful, and these contributed to
their overall positive feelings. This is similar to the findings of Chaudhry et al. [14] and Gater et al. [10]. Some
of the participants highlighted the need for some individual sessions along with the group sessions. They felt
the need to talk about private matters to the facilitator
on a one - to - one basis.
The impact of the PHP intervention was reflected in

an overall positive change in participants' dealing with
family members and children. Particularly participants
reported feeling calmer and much more relaxed when
dealing with their children.

Strengths and limitations of the study
A major strength of this study is the recruitment of
participants from a hard - to - reach British South Asian
community - Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and Indian women.
An additional strength is the ability to engage depressed
women during the postnatal period for up to 6 months,
for follow - up assessments, and for interviews. Another
strength of the study is the use of bilingual researchers
which allowed participants to complete the interviews in
their preferred language. This is one of very few studies
looking at the overall process of development and implementation of culturally - specific psychological interventions for British South Asian women.
This study took place in the North West region of

England; therefore, these results may not be generalizable
to other regions in the UK. Most of the participants were
of first - generation South Asian origin living in England.
These participants were generally isolated and faced



additional social pressures. Another limitation of this
study is the lack of availability of information from
mothers who dropped out and did not attend any of the
sessions. This information would have contributed to a
deeper understanding of the acceptability of PHP intervention. Further limitation of this study is the conservative
definition of completers which was 4 or more sessions out
of 12 sessions. This is a conservative value because the
mean number of sessions was 6. Another limitation of the
study is the lack of inquiry into the impact of intimate
partner or other forms of family violence on postnatal
mental health problems among the participants. The
intervention appears not to have focused on empowerment or other rights - based strategies. Since some of the
quotes by the participants suggest coercion and control,
further studies are required to gain a clearer understanding of these challenges.

Conclusions
The results suggest that this culturally - adapted psychological intervention is acceptable to British South Asian
women. Furthermore, it appears from this qualitative study
that culturally - sensitive psychological interventions can
lead to better health outcomes and higher overall satisfaction levels. Interventions targeting postnatal depression in
South Asian women should pay particular attention to
ways of improving social support, independent coping
strategies, involvement of the culturally - sensitive facilitator,
language aspects, childcare and transport support, and
group discussion techniques. Future research should consider including individual sessions in between group sessions to further improve engagement and perhaps health
and social outcomes as well.
