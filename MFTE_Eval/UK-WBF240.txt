	It's very souls like with regards to bosses and dodging but has something very different, the maps are randomly generated and requires more than one play through to discover all the content.



	There is a variety of game modes so as campaign, adventure mode which is so you can pick specific areas to farm for gear or bosses, lastly is survival mode.



	Survival you start with nothing and loot/upgrade your gear as you go.



	Currently rocking this with @J&B and it's been superb. Hopefully other people pick this up it's a real winner.


Catch you at 3pm lol


Must say I throughly enjoyed this game, I'm a huge soulsborne fan so this game seemed right up my street. Imagine dark souls meets a western and your not far from it. Any way enough spewing about this game I've still got dlc to do. 



	Ps I just got the platinum on ps4 so yea love it.

Great run last night guys, really enjoyed it !


It really was a great raid Bob @Baabcat !




Hello you bunch of beautiful bastards.



	Raging-Welshman (psn) here or Ed lol.



	Met one of your members @Nutcuttlit



	While playing Remnants from the ashes.



	Now got me a new psn bro!



	Question, I love the soulsborne games and their like. So which forum would that topic go in?. Rpg?


Welcome aboard Ed! Hope you enjoy your stay here 🙂 



	As for which subforum the topic you’re wondering about goes I have no clue but I’m sure someone will be along to tell you soon enough. 



	 



	 



	Oh and watch out for Diddums! 😉


Welcome to the group.



	What part of wales you from?


Another sheep worrying bastard eh, ah we take all sorts, even that bald wanker @Nutcuttlit 



	Welcome aboard sunshine👊



	 



	You can stick Souls related content in the RPG section👍


Welcome to FG, Ed! Hope you enjoy your stay around here. I'm sure if you've met Nutty, you would've already realised this is quite a unique place so hopefully that doesn't put you off too much...you do come from the Welsh Land though so you never know 😁



	 



	Phil's on point above about the relevant section for Souls games. If you ever had problems though by accident, we could easily move stuff around in seconds. Do you mainly play survival games only? We do get a whole load of different stuff around here.



	 



	Looking forward to seeing you around online and getting involved whatever we can set up in the future.


Welcome to the site.


Thanks for the...unique welcomes.



	1st. I'm from south Wales not too far from cardiff.



	2nd mostly play soulsborne games. But up for anything.



	3rd. I'm online  most days because I wear the fucking trousers in my house......when my wife says so.


I live not far from cardiff aswell would say out side of Barry but Barry's a shit hole and full of junkies 😂


Welch me to the thunderdome mofuckah!!!! 



	Played a good bit of remnant with this dude.



	Top class guy and a good laugh, hopefully catch up soon bud.


Welcome to FG fella👍


Welcome dude!




Heres some art, resin toys and an ARCADE I made awhile back.


These are amazing Ed! Loving the Arcade setup. Does it have an emulator in that thing? I can see you've put the alien creation on the front too which looks really cool too.



	 



	What drew you into the horror art mate?


Well I have a b.a  in animation and illustration so always loved art. Always been a horror head, grew up in the 80s with freddy, Jason, Michael and all the classic Carpenter films so I've always had a horror twist to my art. Also the arcade has an old PC running the games.


That's truly awesome pal, something that if I knew that could've been a career i'd have loved to have tried.



	 





	 



	Ah, didn't think of that. Easy to add games whenever you want then?


Very cool.  I'd love to have an arcade in my house.




Don’t know if any of you are following the start of the season in this dumpster fire of a year. Just thought I’d start up a convo, and of course, see who you think is going to lose to the Bills when they win the Superbowl.


I've been into it for a long while. Already looks like chiefs are the team to beat. I believe @Baabcat  and @Plumbers Crack  are fans of the sport too. @Gazza Garratt keeps trying to show an interest.


😂😂😂😂😂😂 but, then again, The Washington Football Team won’t be there either!


The bills are currently unbeaten this year (I admit just, and they’ve played the jets and dolphins 😂) and stranger things have happened.


Did Washington replace the redskin tag?


Yeah political correctness pressure, the team stinking and finally Nike and Fed Ex pulling sponsorship unless they changed the name finally made the owner see sense. They are jokingly referred to as the Washington TB Ds 😂😂😂😂😂😂


Yeah I’m big fan, even to the extent I’ve splashed out in the NFL Game Pass app for the full season. Was about £100 but basically get to watch live any match I want, and also can watch 40min match highlights (basically every play).



	amazing value when you think the premier league have just announced £15 pay per view per match.



	Washington fan so nice to see them start ok (in a terrible division !) but loving watching Kansas when I can.


Might take a look at that game pass app


Yeah it’s tempting but might stick with what’s on sky sports. If you don’t mind just 12-18min highlights the nfl channel on You Tube is my Monday work break entertainment 👍🏻


The sky sports channel is a paid channel, how much is it as it doesn't say.


Not sure as it’s not my sky but it’s sports entertainment and movie package with internet


Ok no worries


Yeah @techno  is right, i've been watching from afar for a number of years now but not making the full plunge. I used to play Madden games when I was younger so did get into a little and understand some basic rules back then.



	 



	My mate who live near me follows Jaguars, mainly because they've been the team that's been kind of adopted by the UK in recent years. What should I be looking out for in a team to see good play? I know that @Tiger Burge  is more into College Football over there but that doesn't get televised overseas so would miss most of that.


Best and easiest start I'd say is the NFL show on the Beeb, 1 hour of content a week a great set of presenters and some interesting insights and play breakdowns. It's on late sat night/ sun morning. It's also on demand so previous shows are there.


You can get almost all of the college highlights on YT Lee...they're good to watch.Chris is a Clemson fan.. they're a pretty good team and their QB is likely to be the No. 1 draft pick next year


Thanks @techno  and @Plumbers Crack . I'll take a look at recording some of these shows then.



	 



	Who's on form and looking likely to get to the Superbowl?


Bills, Chiefs and Steelers from the AFC with Packers and Seahawks from NFC



	 



	I would love to see Kansas City Chiefs trying to get back to back Superbowls but I’d also love to see Aaron Rogers and the Green Bay Packers beat them...that would be a mouth watering game. Rodgers has a chip on his shoulder at the moment (GB traded up two places in the draft to get a rookie QB while Rodgers still had 4 years on his contract and they needed reinforcements in other areas) so will have a point to prove. Rodgers is the king imo at the moment but Pat Mahomes of the Chiefs is the next big thing ($500m 10 year contract!!) and he’s the real deal


The NFL continues to become stale for me year after year.


Some of the quarterbacks around the league these days are a joy to watch, Pat Mahomes possibly the pick of the more mobile new style, but Russell Wilson is a game winner and Lamar Jackson can be exciting though they may have worked him out a little after last year.



	 



	This year also looks slightly different there's some big scores and it might be down to a lack of pre-season.


First thing is don’t be a Jacksonville, Cincinnati, or any New York fan. That is just purgatory for nfl fans. Top QB is always helpful over just talented receivers, but a good defence, especially defensive line is key too.



	 



	college football is really just Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State, LSU, Oklahoma and Georgia for top college football and are pretty much in the final four each year.


As much as I was confident when staring this topic, from AFC it’ll be the Chiefs, Steelers, Ravens and (hopefully) Bills. NFC will be between Seahawks and Greenbay, everyone else just seems injured.



	 



	So packers vs Bills (but more likely chiefs).


Delighted to see the Washington Football Team make the playoffs, 7 and 9 record!! Glory awaits !! If everyone else gets Covid. 



	Cant wait for wild card weekend though.


Home field advantage as well...I'll be happy if Chase Young sacks TB a couple of times and Alex Smith throws a TD pass


What a terrible division that is 😂


Yep, absolute shite show..the WFT have a cr@p owner, decent coach who unfortunately has cancer, a veteran QB who nearly lost a leg but came back. They cut the first choice QB for being a tw@t when the back up was injured and the vet was coming back from injury. The offense is mediocre but with a decent running back. The defence could probably hold their own in any division and have basically carried the offense and won the division for the club



	 



	So yeah, while we're not expecting to win, I imagine TB12 isn't exactly looking forward to the prospect of Chase and the boys trying to get through his face mask! Also, they're in our backyard, Brady has never had to go on the road in the play offs because the Patriots were always the best team in their conference so always held home advantage. So there is the possibility of an upset.



	 



	Come and play, Tommy boy, come and play.... we won't hurt you 🤣😎




Just a shame it’s on at 1am in the morning !!


Yep, just highlights for me I’m afraid


Yeah I watch regular season using the been show, I like Osi.



	The Superbowl I watch about 40 mins behind and catch up at the end.

Need 1 more so bumping this up !!


I've been on Discord this morning asking for one more. I'd really be surprised if we can't get any one of the other regulars to join and help out later. We should be able to smash through it too.




Looks like theres a playstation update out thats changing a number of things existing whilst getting ready for PS5. Grabbed the following from Playstation:



	 



	Includes changes to Party and Messages features, new avatars, updated parental controls and more.



	 



	




I hear they're also going to be listening and recording party chat. Hope that's not true,



	 



	Anyway, PSN is currently up the spout for me.


No need for the 2 step verification change as there was nothing wrong with it in the first place where they would send you a txt message and you can generate a password.


What gets me is the re-entering your credit card expiry date and 3 number code...I don’t mind doing it, it’s the “your last log in was from a different console” rubbish that gets me
