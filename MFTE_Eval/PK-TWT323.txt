@omar_quraishi @TheRealPCB is not Govt funded organisation where as PSB has returned Rs. 440 million unused fund to govt question should be asked to POA and PSB about their failures to market other games specially hockey.


@cricketpakcompk Triggered


@Mubeen_Ul_Haq @TheRealPCB is not responsible for the state of other sports it is self funded organisation who get funds from broadcasting deals and sponsorship. @GovtofPakistan is responsible for all this mess.


@SSEHBAI1 I thought you were a good journalist but the language you use today for her is not good. You should delete this tweet. Whether you liked her or not you shouldn‚Äôt stoop this level.


@murtazawahab1 @BBhuttoZardari this is really getting out of hand. How long will this go on? Or @ImranKhanPTI is also responsible for all this conversion shit? Are your govt is really powerless to deal  https://t.co/HTci1JVG7s

@amarguriro This is not the iconic W-11 buses if you have ever seen them they were yellow in colour these are the buses of other different routes which are now running on W-11 route. BTW they should be replaced long ago but  for Karachi city, provincial and federal govt don‚Äôt have resources.


@murtazawahab1 Sir if you have read the news carefully invoice date was June 18, 2018 and PTI govt was formed in 2018 August so this may be done in care taker govt.

@ShumailaPPP @murtazawahab1 Why doesn‚Äôt your govt solve the issue of forced conversion of under age girls enough of this gimmickry address the real issue of hindu community.


@PTIKhurshidAlam @AiliaZehra Let me explain you OLT is a public transport project which is for the use of general public where is PA building is for MPA which draw salaries and other perks from taxes. At least OLT can recover it‚Äôs partial cost from fares.


@PTIKhurshidAlam @AiliaZehra And where as What MPAs do in PA we have all seen it and you can‚Äôt recover even one rupee from them. BTW mostly public transport projects in the world are subsidised.
And what about Peshawar BRT isn‚Äôt it subsidised.


@ZahidHussainZah @UsamaKhawar @adeel_azhar That‚Äôs not even a food. BTW your world famous food street sucks big time even a smaller bbq seller in Karachi tastes thousands time better than your food street bbq.

@RePorter1979 @OonibAzam_ @murtazawahab1 He will also getting financial support for running of KMC to dilute the support of PTI and MQM. To show the Karachiites that PPP care which itself is a mirage.


@ZuhairAbbasMir Good to see GoS trying to provide quality health care to people of Sindh. I have just one question why people need to come to Karachi for medical treatment when they can get these medical facilities in cities near them just asking. @murtazawahab1

@AmrullahSaleh2 Ever heard of precision guided missiles. Pak uses against India on Feb27 firing from our side of LoC to the Indian Positions. But obviously you needed some thing to hide your incompetence.


@AmrullahSaleh2 Why share evidence in DM when your opening blaming Pakistan for you incompetence. This show you have nothing to show just accusing to hide incompetency.


@AfghanistanDef9 @taahir_khan @AmrullahSaleh2 @ForeignOfficePk BTW all the TTP commanders were killed in Afghanistan after operation 


@MaryamNSharif  problem is that your family is actively involve in politics where as Niazi‚Äôs sons are not involved in Pakistan‚Äôs politics so there is the problem which you don‚Äôt want to understand. And she is rightly annoyed for involving her sons.

@Jahanzeyb @DrWajidAli18 @OwaisTohid @mirzaiqbal80 @MHasnainPak @TheRealPCB You have to accept that Haris Rauf is bigger  than Imam although Imam have talent he needs to work on his strike rate. Still baffles me why he always get selected ahead of hasnain.

@TOLOnews And when given opportunity to flee the country by land all of them will be making queue at Torkhum and Chamman border.


@IffatHasanRizvi Because they were in power now the power is shifted to Pashtuns so they have started to blame Pakistan. Obviously taking note from their previous masters.


@husainhaqqani @SAMRIReports You are right people of Afghanistan are still living in 1990s.

@DennisCricket_ Obviously not. Remember when Srilankan's broke the bio secure bubble they were send back. But here Indians attended the book launch without informing the ECB and their coach tested positive during the test no eyes were blinked. Because of BCCI financial power.


@Asad_Umar Please make roads first there are dirt tracks in Karachi for off roading.

@HashTagCricket üòÇüòÇüòÇ in Pakistan politics India is not even a topic for future PM. Get a life we have more important issues than discussing üáÆüá≥. 


@IuYumaan @HashTagCricket Main topic of Pakistan politics corruption, economy, inflation, sexual violence against kids and women even in Azad Kashmir election there is no mention of India. People like you are obsessed with Pakistan not us.


@BakhtawarBZ I think she is talking about  mazar which is in Karachi and Karachi is in Sindh. Also due to Muharram there was a heavy LEA presence in nearby areas of  so it was Police fault which is under the Command of your CM.


@AK_Forty7 @VeqarIslam @PTIofficial @ImranKhanPTI @BBhuttoZardari @murtazawahab1 @MuradAliShahPPP Actually all district central is shambles with overflowing of sewerage, damaged roads and pile of grabage around Siraj ud dola and saifi colleges.

@bhogleharsha Not every team can win test after 2/3 or 6/41 in first session.


@BBCYaldaHakim @AqilShah_ West is proud of investigative journalism then why they are not able to pin point the locations of safe houses of Taliban in Pakistan. This is just propaganda if US can kill Bin Laden in Pakistan why they haven't done same for so called Taliban Quetta Shura. I rest my case.


@atifthepoet With fake accent and big mansion you can talk about being a house wife. But if there are 5 children and average income of man of the house is less than 15k what should you do?


@footiestatto @swarrimaslam And one has out scored the much younger guy in SeriaA at the age of 36

BTW at least we don‚Äôt call pulao a .


@murtazawahab1 Let‚Äôs see what you can do in 2 years which your govt was not able to do in 13 years for Karachi.


@AamnaFasihi @hoflolz Here it is major portion of Karachi taxes is direct taxes which doesn‚Äôt include GST and Custom duties. This data is of 2018. In 2019 Karachi‚Äôs Jodia  alone has pay more income tax than whole Lahore. Go figure out why we beat our chest  https://t.co/LTYVYHpj1E
