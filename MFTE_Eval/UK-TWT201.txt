Less social media more direct action.


Good people of Tottenham should seek out an independent MP at the next election.
They should organise& support someone who agrees with their politics& make this their focus to actually get rid of all Tories.
Blairism is Thatcherism!

@robjeffecology @bethanyusher Surely an academic and author who has been shown how wrong they are would have some integrity and delete the lies being told.

Truth doesn't matter these days, only the narrative and framing of a lie is considered acceptable.


@yossarian44 @mrcraftyg @Trickyjabs Furthermore your mistake is, in the face of all the evidence that Labour Thatcherism is Better than Conservative Thatcherism negates all evidence that Blair actually put the legislation & framework in place for which the Tories are abusing today.

They are all one and the same!


@yossarian44 @mrcraftyg @Trickyjabs By accepting Thatcherism in Labour you're advocating for a dictatorship, an elective one all the same, we've had elections since the 70s, but we've never changed its internal politics or more crucially its economics & accepting this, you're endorsing #21stCenturyFascism


@yossarian44 @mrcraftyg @Trickyjabs You do understand Red Tories advocate Neoliberalism as the basic economic orthodoxy?

Neoliberalism designed by the Chicago Boy's & used by Fascist Dictator General Augusto Pinochet.

A man Thatcher adored & gave safe haven too?

Thatcherism in Labour or Tory Party is Far Right!


So why did the Labour Right attack Labour (their own party) more than the Tories did?
https://t.co/IoKhPvlHrN

Oh wait is it because they are all Tories?
https://t.co/Egy7xxanH5 https://t.co/UEJUZxPqhp


@yossarian44 @mrcraftyg @Trickyjabs Greatly missing the entire point of having Conservative Ideology lead the Labour Party at this current moment in time.

When the opposition and the government are all serving the same interests. It is not a political choice, it's not even a democracy as they defend a Kleptocracy.


@LuckyHeronSay A consumerist capitalists wet dream.


@yossarian44 @mrcraftyg @Trickyjabs Surely if we are to stand against Tories, then the actual Tory enablers in Labour should be the first place you start?

Because after all it is their job to ensure the conservative establishment stay in charge.

It's the reason why Blair started privatisation of schools and NHS


@yossarian44 @mrcraftyg @Trickyjabs Which Tories? The Thatcherites in Labour or just the Tory Party?
https://t.co/fiNdvPIOdH
Is it this Blairism that's built in Thatcherism?
https://t.co/E6odf4oB71
With his top adviser saying, we are Thatcherites?

@SimonWe63114983 @jsewellmcevoy @Jessthelefty So you don't want to read the links that contains all policies of New Labour's Conservative Politics?
https://t.co/m3BQH26jyk

After all that's what Starmer has asked us to embrace.


@SimonWe63114983 @jsewellmcevoy @Jessthelefty But now he is pro Brexit he is forgiven for having designed a Brexit Policy that the red wall rejected.
Because it did the job of intention.
Remove a centre left leader & put ab actual Tory in charge of the Labour Party.
Slow claps for wanting "Tories Out"
https://t.co/RprFHZe8WF


@SimonWe63114983 @jsewellmcevoy @Jessthelefty I mean it's not like their is evidence of Thatcherism in the Labour Party?

Here is Blair saying he continued Thatcterism.

While Mandelson wrote endless articles on being a Tory.
https://t.co/Egy7xxanH5


@SimonWe63114983 @jsewellmcevoy @Jessthelefty So the Starmer Mr Remain at all costs who had his policies on Brexit written by Peter Thatcherite Mandelson who kicked Mike Glasworthy out of his own People Vote Campaign to bring down Labour, had nothing to do with it?
Now the Red Stories are driving Labour no one cares?


What's the word for people who committ oppression, but instead of fixing it, turn up to the food banks their oppression creates and act as if they are doing right by society?

It like Starmerites, you can't use Canary, Skwawkbox, Novara Media, Evolve Politics, Another Angry Voice because they're always goin to be critical of Nu Labour.

They are Thatcherites every last one of them.


@buffybatik @edwardpoole1975 @UKLabour The Lib Dems will gain more than anyone, traditionally the second home of soft Tories.

Starmer is a wet blanket who is seen supporting Johnson and offering no alternative to this continuing disaster.

But then again the media controls the true power in British Politics.


Sweet lord, just did our Christmas shopping and it is around 35% more expensive this year than the last two years.

@UrbaneSlave @PhilipProudfoot Starmer said he would stand by the policies of 2019 and 2017.

And instead asked us to embrace Blairism.

They are all Thatcherites!


@robertcp @Gina_Foster_ @CHHoulbrook Blair was always going after unions. 
Blair's entire time was an anti union, neoliberal capitalist wet dream.
To blow smoke up the arse of a self confessed Thatcherite as some sort of win for workers?? It was unions fighting back against Blair.
https://t.co/f2TOI3D8hi


@Andrew_ALM_W @paintandashes @PhilipProudfoot You will not solve these issues with Blairism mark 2 version of Market Capitalism. It's like asking Johnson to clean up his own mess.

They never do because they are all part of the same ideological neoliberal orthodoxy that seeks to protect capital at all costs.


@Andrew_ALM_W @paintandashes @PhilipProudfoot We know it didn't as Blairism is Thatcterism.
https://t.co/E6odf4oB71
Something Starmer wants us to embrace
https://t.co/fiNdvPIOdH
Nearly all the issues society has today were started under Blair, which included deregulation of the energy sectors & fossil fuel companies.


@Andrew_ALM_W @paintandashes @PhilipProudfoot on technology that isn't invented yet or been tested at an industrial scale.

He has no plans to Re-Nationalise Energy which is the most vital action to take when you are seriously considering decarbonisation.

Thinking that getting Labour in power will change. It won't. It didnt


@Andrew_ALM_W @paintandashes @PhilipProudfoot As a former Environmental Scientist, I can see not a single policy from Starmer that is in anyway shape or form going to change the current trajectory for the climate.

He has said on multiple occasions he will take his lead from businesses and like the Tories pinning his hopes


@janfromdevon @EssexSocialist @CHHoulbrook So why did he lie regarding Brexit?
He said it was Boris's deal or No Deal, even though constitutional lawyers informed the house that Johnson couldn't deliver No Deal.
Why has he reneged on every pledge?
Why did he lie about the words JC used and writing for Murdoch?


@CHHoulbrook The liberty of a democracy is not safe if people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than the democratic state itself. That in its essence is fascism: ownership of government by an individual, by a group, or any controlling private power-FDR


@CHHoulbrook https://t.co/fiNdvPIOdH
Is it this Blairism? Tony Blair says it was his job to build on Thatcherism
https://t.co/E6odf4oB71
His advisor is an open Thatcherite
https://t.co/Egy7xxanH5
With policies that the Tories are abusing today
https://t.co/m3BQH26jyk
Or does that not matter?


@mattzarb @TombstoneDoc He is a Tory nonce and all
https://t.co/Egy7xxanH5
Starmer's top advisor is a THATCHERITE.
What does that make Starmer?
The man who said embrace Blairism.
This Blairism? Tony Blair - It was my job to build on Thatcherism.
https://t.co/E6odf4oB71


@PhilipProudfoot Don't forget Blair said it was his job to build on Thatcherism.
https://t.co/E6odf4oB71

Which is why so many of his policies like NHS and School Privatisation, anti immigrant and refugee legislation was passed.
Nevermind his attacks on the welfare state, disabled and sick.


@robertcp @Gina_Foster_ @CHHoulbrook The thing is, it wasn't a strengthening of unions it was an attack defeated more than any. 2002 was a year he openly attacked the unions.
To suggest otherwise is glossing over the openly Conservative policies by Blair.
Thatcherism is Blairism after all.
https://t.co/E6odf4oB71


@Andrew_ALM_W @Mr_Vayne @PhilipProudfoot As a Socialist you would be advocating his removal.
He wants us to embrace Blairism.
Like this Blairism?
https://t.co/E6odf4oB71
Advised by Thatcherite Mandelson
https://t.co/Egy7xxanH5
While Blair installed all the legislation & framework Tories are using
https://t.co/m3BQH26jyk


@Andrew_ALM_W @paintandashes @PhilipProudfoot Yet they don't have any major plans to Re-Nationalise Energy & work towards decarbonisation.
You can't save the climate by asking people to make micro changes like they're advocating.
You've to target the worst offenders at home & with global pressure.
Policies Starmer hasn't got


@thepileus Guilty


@robertcp @Gina_Foster_ @CHHoulbrook Awh, you have know that isn't true.
In here is a copy of every Tory Policy & anti union legislation Blair did during his Tenure.
https://t.co/m3BQH26jyk

It includes NHS & School Privatisation, attacks on immigrants, refugees and the disabled as well as bulldozing social housing


@Gina_Foster_ @DavidRi06498346 @CHHoulbrook https://t.co/E6odf4oB71
Because Starmer wants Blairism and Blairism is Thatcherism.

@StevenHurst1977 I was literally just formulating a similar tweet in  my head when I came upon this.

The Guardian and the rest of the media are as complicit and guilty as the capitalists themselves.
They think half baked trivialised articles justifies their credibility or lack of.


Are you having a laugh?
They want Blairism which is Thatcherism.
https://t.co/E6odf4oB71

Which led to Blair installing the infrastructure and laws that the current Tories are abusing.
From NHS privatisation to attacks on migrants and refugees.
