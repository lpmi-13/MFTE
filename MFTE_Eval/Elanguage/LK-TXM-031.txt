Good to hear from you. I have been super busy at work. I didn't get any chance to look into it. Is it any possibility to dedicate this  to another group member. Up to end of Jan I'm tied up. My sincere apologies. Give me a shout if you fail any other options👍
Thanks

14/12/2020, 08:36 - $AB: Also you got to bare in mind the technical side of this project(data usage to connect many members. This is not like having a daily on line office zoom  meeting with 6 to 7 members of staff). You need to get the technical side on point. Just an advice.

14/12/2020, 17:49 - $AB: Yeah everything is virtual globally right now.There is a load of ground work to be done on this event to reach success. A  Getting contact with members to find a suitable time etc as Per to their work & commitments & time zones.

 B.You can get connected to .100mrmbers but one to one on the free version. In my opinion that will not work well. If you wanna properly conduct the event you need to get the paid version. I work mainly on zoom meetings & I know how it works. When I find a bit of free time try to find the cheapest & the most effective way to hold this event. Just bits of advice
14/12/2020, 17:51 - $AB: Google, Gmail and YouTube down worldwide

15/12/2020, 13:43 - $AB: What I suggest is the event host  to download the free version of Zoom  & have it in placed, pay & upgrade when ever a such an  event. It is not expensive at all, only few quid it will cost for one off event. You don't have to give it to a company to set it up at all. It is super simple with a bit of IT knowledge. Once you upgrade the link. The host will have to set   the date & time & just  send the link to the participants network. You will have to find a host,  who has time to do this😊
15/12/2020, 13:49 - $M: Very sorry. I will not be able to handle this.
