10/10/2020, 5:28 pm - $A: 
10/10/2020, 6:00 pm - $D: 2,3 , avf shows st segment elevation
10/10/2020, 6:01 pm - $D: 1,v4,v depression
10/10/2020, 6:52 pm - $C: inferior MI there will be bradicordyia (as here 40bpm) because its supplied by right coronary artry which also supply SA nodes.
10/10/2020, 7:06 pm - $A: What else???
10/10/2020, 7:06 pm - $A: What else?
10/10/2020, 7:46 pm - $E: Cant recognise more
10/10/2020, 7:47 pm - $B: P wave is not followed by qrs complex
10/10/2020, 7:47 pm - $A: Cant you appreciate complete heart block?????
10/10/2020, 7:49 pm - $B: Missed beat in 2nd degree
10/10/2020, 7:50 pm - $A: Answer should never be given in this way. You can easily get into trouble if you come across a  nasty examiner like me.
For instance, my next immediate question would then be:
What if the left system is dominant????
10/10/2020, 8:00 pm - $C: Yes Sir..
10/10/2020, 8:03 pm - $C: 
10/10/2020, 8:04 pm - $C: Sir I don't know what mean by *left system dominant*.?
10/10/2020, 8:10 pm - $A: Plz concentrate on the ecg for the time being.
10/10/2020, 8:10 pm - $E: 
10/10/2020, 8:12 pm - $E: Sir what other features?
10/10/2020, 8:51 pm - $C: In left system dominant there will be no bradycardia b/c SA will be spared but post MI bradycardia is mostly seen in inferior wall MI b/c there are large cholinergic ganglia and postganglionic fibers in anteratrial septum. So ischemia of these structure causes sinus bradycardia and peripheral vasodilation (vagus reflex). Along this coronary artery occlusion can produce reflex decrease in sympathetic system to both ❤️ and peripheral vessels.
10/10/2020, 8:58 pm - $A: You simply wouldnt understand.
10/10/2020, 8:59 pm - $D: Sir I guess left heart dominant means posterior decending artery is originate from left cimcumflex artery ? 🤔
10/10/2020, 9:00 pm - $A: Was there any hint in the question to which you have given such a long, answer
10/10/2020, 9:01 pm - $A: Excellent.
So in that case, the culprit would be LCx and not RCA.
I hope $S3P4 will understand.
10/10/2020, 9:02 pm - $C: Yes Sir.. understood..
10/10/2020, 9:02 pm - $D: Thank you sir
10/10/2020, 9:04 pm - $A: Bottomline is:

Stick to the point.
Read the question carefully.
Dont try to over explain things. You will end up spoiling your result.
Look for simple things.
You should have read the subject carefully

11/10/2020, 9:15 pm - $G: We will follow the ABCDE
First we will look at the airway which is trachea no deviation, the hilar structures are normal not lymph node enlargement etc.
Breathing we look for the lungs and pleura and divide them into 3 zones and there is homogeneous opacity in the right side in middle and lower zones,
Cardiac there is cardiomegaly because the cardiothoracic ratio is more than 50%
Diaphragm there is costophrenic blunting in the right side of the heart
