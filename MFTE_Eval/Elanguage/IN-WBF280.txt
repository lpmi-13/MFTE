	you mean your source gets almost 60% discount but can’t procure one for you at full MRP?!?


v I dont have your connections sir





Either this source took it for 17k at gunpoint (in which case why even pay 17k) or is B Sing you. 17K is lower than the base import cost of the console The Play Station India country head can't get it for that less even for his own kids.


 🙃


Yup man


That is only info source man.



	 



	Guy got PS4 for 17k at Launch. Huge discounts they get.


@pxxxxxxxxxxxxxe Bro no connections. This is not a bulk order thread. Just for information so people can share info on availability, preorders, etc



	 



	If a bulk order works out, that's a bonus


...


Only because Unlike Delhi/NCR, distribution for Mumbai is separate from Pune.


, go get it from Mumbai.. Is it a big deal

	can give you updates on launch but cant procure you one?!?


Most of them (GTS, Gameloot) will ship.


BSing for sure. Anyway his infos were false as well 


	 



	So the Mumbai ones cant be shipped to Pune?




I've spoke with these guys. They'll only be able to tell us about bulk orders once Sony gives quantity allocations to retailers at some point before the 12th.


Digital edition for me. I'll inquire around local Croma and Vijay sales tomorrow.


Why in OP for nash its Physical and others are Standard? 



	 



	Arent they same?


Mrp. dont keep any hope for discounts


How much will be quoted ?


Ok. Thanks.



	 



	Standard Edition for me


We can have multiple threads for multiple cities/regions. It's just a matter of calling stores in that city/area and listing the ones that are going to get stock.


Everybody isn't from these cities. 



	 



	I can manage someone to collect if I can get a confirmation that we can place a bulk order and can secure a PS5 then COUNT ME IN. 



	 



	Physical edition (disc version) for me.


No i mean our bulk orders if it happens


Any retailer where you may have seen PS4 demo units at is an authorised retailer.

There are two types of authorised retailers. One category deals directly with Sony, and the other that deals with Sony’s distributors.

Best to just call your local retailer and ask them. Sony or their distributors will reach out to them next week.


Any idea for local stores in Andheri regions who will get stock? Or if other retail chains like Kohinoor will be getting launch day stock?


Put me down for std edition


Mumbai buyers living in suburbs or closer to thane can try the game store at Viviana mall. Pretty reliable guy and keeps all legit sony stuff and is open for midnight launchs. You can add his number on WA to see his catalogue. 



	 



	Jai Ganesh game store.



	09821229899


It’s easy to go to thane. But difficult to come out of it. 

	 



	I had to get married to escape


I asked him and he said they don't have any information yet.


Keep us posted...but going to Thane


I have messaged him for the same lets see what he replies.


Add me up for Disc Version


You can get it for all of us


I live in thane.. so it better to get it either from him, sony center or online.



	 



	Contacted him, given my number to him as well... he says whether I will get it or not is purely based on the units allocated to him. So he has a list of people who enquired and interested in getting one.




He is probably taking about Game4U


Absolutely. And considering they are the love child of Sony - Distri, they are wayyy more reliable than random retailers or even big box stores who sell a PS5 with as much enthusiasm as a sandwich grill toaster. 

	 



	I felt not many were chiming about the existence of GTS which personally for metros or the places they operate out of, is an absolute god-send in terms of assured day 1 availability in store. My apprehension was the whole culling of heavy discounts we all used to enjoy during the ps3/360 gen with them shaping up as retailers. Miss those days but equally love GTS for the honest and prompt manner they operate. 

	 



	Anyone with a GTS outlet feasible to travel to on 12th should more than consider them. The only scary part would be the expected mad rush of people and I hope safety takes precedence in this situation.


What wounds? GTS is pretty fantastic, especially for day one game deliveries. And yeah, like I said before, they're a close Play Station partner (they offer digital PSN vouchers thanks to this partnership), so they're definitely a very good bet for securing a PS5. They will also get good allocation because Sony loves supporting gaming specialists.


What did they do lmao


Why are Mumbai guys considering everything but GTS? Considering their span across the city, most ppl should be able to commute to one of their outlets and easily lock one in. 



	Or are the wounds from a decade ago still ripe? I went from being anti G4U/GTS to absolutely loving them in my absence here. Never failed me once. Even once.


I pinged him too. No info yet. Theres a queue not sure how long.



	 



	M in Pune though


lol yeah...tell him bulk order 


True to all of the above, except the guy running their Instagram needs to cool it.


You know my pain don’t you? 

	 



	All those years of travelling 2.5 hrs each way for picking up games Day 1 


	Not to mention buying two copies of each game 


	 



	If not for marriage, I’d be old, broke and senile all together


Damm. The Demand is really high it seems. 



	 



	Unless good stocks coming in, its gonna be disappointment to so many


Would rather take the vaccine on my pee pee than ever go back to thane.


Nothing is exciting about Mumbai traffic. You make it passable by guzzling lots of


Absolutely. 



	 



	Now there are quite a few options to get games Day 1 in thane.


Don't you feel that's exciting


So Bloodbath and tears both confirmed for 12th. 

	 



	This is not going to go down well. For buyers that is.


I need to check this out.


Can confirm. If you try to get out of Thane station in anything other than rickshaw you get trapped in Hawking-Einstein equation of time loop forever.


Just spoke a Sony Center guy in Vakola... poor guy was so frustrated “...” 



	 



	called reliance digital and croma as well, near infiniti mall... both said “” In polite words...


Add me on this list please for the disc version




Most of them are from IVG


Not high demant just few guys calling non stop


Do you think 6-8 months down the line covid will be gone...It's here to stay. Just have to learn to fight it now.


Well said - that too with this covid outbreak I gonna get it 6-8 months down the line. 

It won’t make sense expose yourself.


Would be wise to keep the expectations in check for this round of orders.



	 



	I'm not buying one at launch anyway, so will get it sometime later in the year or in 2022. Hopefully (pretty sure), the situation with the stocks will be sorted out by then.


This is the hope...


Looks highly unlikely as he will mostly get 10-15 units max and he already has 25-30 confirmed buyers who are his old customers who buy software regularly from him.



	 



	You can try Jain Traders in Thane or Vijay Sales at Ghodbunder.


His whatsapp status everyday is about PS5 



	 



	If that 35K units is true then nobody needs to worry. Lets hope its true hai na  @rxxxxxxxxxl


I hope that Jai Ganesh Guy gets good amount of units


Update from Sony Center in Lower Parel


Yes , but as I said highly unlikely


Thane people can give E-Mart games also a try.


Spoke with Jai Ganesh he has been allocated 14 units which are already booked.


He said you have to buy a game and also an accessory along with console.


Yeah Jai Ganesh guy is good... though he did not had grey stock at my time of purchase.



	 



	Enways, all the best for your purchase.


Wow.... when I bought my grey market XSX from him.... that time also, he was forcing me to buy a game. I straight away said NO.


Yea the owner is pretty “” type of guy. I prefer to buy from Jai Ganesh than E-Mart Games.


Sold out in my country :P


In case anyone got an extra in Mumbai/Pune, please post I will snag one.




Which country?


@Hxxxxxd Proof Sam I have ordered from Amazon.  You can update the OP.


My order from RD got canned, If someone has an extra please spare


If anyone has extra units please let me know, expecting RD cancellation as well!


Tried, couldnt get through. . Did you manage to get one?


Update the OP with members who are still looking to buy one,



	 



	If anyone has a spare order to give to a Mumbai/Thane/Pune buyer can also post here, so it becomes easier to coordinate. The main PS5 thread will be difficult to keep track of.


I got one from offline already. Was just browsing through Amazon randomly, saw it and posted it for whoever wanted it.


I need a ps5 , am from Mumbai . Can anyone help


PS5 Pre order up on Amazon once again. Everyone who needs it - Go Now!!


someone is reincarnated, Are you looking for a PS5  Remember your ID from old days..


Nah, I have a PS5 lol. I don't know which damn thread to check for PS5 discussion.


Sup homie


No Hyderabad


@Sxxxxy Funk Here is that thread


@rxxxxxxxxxl Thanks mate.



	My Reliance order got cancelled so looking for a ps5 in Pune or Mumbai. 



	Help is much appreciated.


How many People has reliance FXXXXX damn.


That twitter poll had >300 people responding. I am guessing at least a 1000 orders happened there, out of which they cancelled 500-600.




Which clearly means they are either stopping orders manually, or there backend is some trash 3 rd party crap.


Come to Bangalore thread, the south derby is all there


Missed you Sam


Good morning everyone,



	 



	I'm looking for a ps5 in Mumbai. Please let me know if anyone has a spare one on launch. Cheers


What about the sony center store next to Vijay sales at ghodbunder rd? Any contacts there to snag a piece at launch?


No man. I am not from.mumbai. Mumbai guys please help him.


Okay cool. I plan to visit that shop on 2nd and see if I can snag one. Wonder how many IVG members I might bump into


I say 0 members from Mumbai. Because thane is not part of Mumbai 


	 



	There's also an 11th commandment "Thou shalt not look down upon thaneites" but nobody really believes it.


Sigh.


.





who else wants in Mumbai ? There is someone selling on TP but have not approved for all so it can go to one of the needy ones here


ME PLEASE





I could take it.


Linked to your PM, the guy is hardly active on forums.




I wish I was back in BLR now. Tried calling the local Sony Centre in this City (Cochin), the number does not exist.
