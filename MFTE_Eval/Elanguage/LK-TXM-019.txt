The Usability Testing Study will be conducted today at 2.30 pm hope you guys will be free, it'll be done on Google meet or zoom, no need to panic as you all don't need to turn on cameras or mics and the tasks are pretty simple, login stuff, search stuff and record how long it took to perform those.
We have created a whatsapp group for the purpose of sharing instructions and the meeting link, the invite link for the group -
