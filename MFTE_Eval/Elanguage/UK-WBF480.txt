Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids?

Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?

Try acid and get - up worse that my life is?

My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight

But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to -

And Dr. Dre said

"Slim Shady you a base-head!"

Uh-uh!

"So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"

Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else

'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt

Got - off and ripped Pamela Lee's - off

And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross

I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my -, faster than a fat -

Who sat down too fast

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High

Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty five

I smacked him in his face with an eraser

Chased him with a stapler

Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers

Walked in the - club, had my jacket zipped up

Flashed the bartender, then stuck my - in the tip cup

Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship

While they screamin' at me

"Let's just be friends!"

Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to

I just found out my mom does more dope than I do

I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper

Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her

You know you blew up when the women rush your stands

Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans

I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive

Am I comin' or goin'?

I can barely decide

I just drank a fifth of vodka

Dare me to drive?

All my life I was very deprived

I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide

Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk

I spit when I talk, I'll - anything that walks

When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits

How you gonna - feed me, Mom? You ain't got no -!

I lay awake and strap myself in the bed

With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
