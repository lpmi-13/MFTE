üòÖ I'll post a better podcast tomorrow

it was the most interesting one so far thoughüòÖ
20:34:

Social media has become a place where people cancel each other unfortunately
20:42:
$V7:
Don't you think this comes from a sense of insecurity/lack within, where we need to show that others are wrong in order to feel good about ourselves.
If we could realise our true self , and the internal happiness , we wouldn't rely on some platform or some discussions to have that sense of being right.
And then possibly look at things in a balanced and more open way
20:46:
$W7:

Hey loved this poem, saved it for my future reference..
20:48:
$A2:

Agreed. Social media has become a platform where bullying is somehow promoted because everyone is involved in it somehow.
20:50:
$W7:
Also the point is many people have polarised thinking attitude vs nuanced thinking.. They think at the extremes such as things can be only right or wrong, good or evil etc
Here's the article which will clear why this happens.. And how to practice nuanced thinking
20:59:
$M7:

I totally agree with the last point. Also we feel "satisfied"proving someone wrong or even pushing your opinion on to others and making sure they think your side is right. Some do for popularity attention some do just because they feel rest, calm, satisfied and this feeling of achievement.
21:00:
$C5:
Opened now??
21:00:
$P6:

Dude try to understand their situation. They try their best.
Whatever your doubts are you can search for their answers from other YouTube channels plus there are many websites where you can post your questions and get answers from experts
21:01:
$W7:
Y can't i share a link
21:02:
$V7:

It's not allowed. Too many Recommenda tions are distracting
21:03:

Yes exactly
21:04:

Yes yes , that is what I meant by a balanced outlook , just couldn't find the right word for it.
This attitude is possessed by many in our country which is eating up our nation from within.
The right , left , liberals , communists ,  and other such labels do no good for the country , they just contribute in riots and divide people.
Truth often lines in the middle
We need more balanced individuals for the good.
21:14:
$CD:

Also it weeds out personal links like personal channels
21:19:
$W7:

Yes, but the article which i was talking about is very imp in understanding the viewpoint y don't people practice nuanced thinking.. Which is so so imp specially for our young generation..which I found it twitter..
21:28:
$X7:
Try to Listen the Modern India Podcast on Spotify its really nice and it and really Help for the students for History I cannot Send the link but that Pocast is very nice
21:29:
Its really a Worth Watching I can Say....
21:41:
$Y7:

21:46:
Sending*
21:47:

I'll try to be more mindful.

Anyway, thanks for the productive discussion today.

Here‚Äôs a show for you‚Ä¶ The Federal Reserve Pt. 1 episode of Conspiracy Theories

09:44:
$CD:
Today's episode is a bit of a fun episode. It's a conspiracy theory based on the US Federal Reserve.

The thing I like about conspiracy theories is just the premise, the exercise that we stretch our imagination in a different way. In our hustle filled, Uber productive world, sometimes it helps to just listen to something completely different.
18:40:
$CD:
Sorry for the delay, the group is open for discussions.
18:47:
$U7:

‚úåÔ∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
18:55:

On the last point, I feel the same. Even while typing this, while discussing, there is some kind of insecurity, and to save ourselves from that, many people go overboard with their confidence.
19:32:
$A2:
Conspiracy theories are so much fun because they are like 2 sides of a card. One is the side presented while the other is always hidden. The theories are so popular because they present the facts in such a way that one might believe them at first.

Even in this case, while I thought the theory regarding the Freemasons and Illuminati might not be that convincing but the previous 2 theories definitely had something substantial.

Since they handled so much capital, they could easily manipulate the economy. So there might be something behind it.

But the 2nd theory was the most believable. Certainly there were a lot others that actually wanted to assassinate JFK but the Central bank could have partnered with CIA to pull off the assassination of not 1 but 2 US Presidents. The strings kind of connect here and that might have been the case.
20:01:
$Z7:
Sir please take podcast and brief discussion on topic network marketing. Majorly young students are go into this business such business stop their growth and they are only trapped in business environment but actually there not in business. Company such as forever living products and vestige and etc . They are trapped in this type of fraud business. please this is important for young student to understand that after seventeen to 23 age they most important and costly thing is only TIME so they not goes in such scam and fraud. please come with this type of discussion üíô
I wish you may see my message.
20:01:
$CD:
I don't take such recommendations here for specific podcasts. I have nothing to do with network marketing and unless there are podcasts like that produced in India, it is difficult for me to find one topic for podcasts
20:01:
$A8:
Any podcasts for mental health?
20:01:
$CD:
It takes a fair bit of effort to find good podcasts since I personally listen to them before I recommend them. This means searching for individual podcasts is really difficult
20:02:
$Z7:

This is major topic so many students are trapped in this environment.
20:02:
$CD:

I particularly don't listen to them. You can search for them on Spotify and give it a try
20:02:
$B8:
Is there any podcast on 
20:02:
$CD:
Guys
20:02:
If you want podcasts you can search for them on Spotify, Stitcher, Apple podcasts üôÇ
20:03:
Please dont ask me for each individual query you have. That is not possible for me to find out particularly for what you want.
20:22:
$CD:
Before I would recommend any episode I personally listen to them. So for me to say any podcast is good I'll have to listen to it. So each individual requests are really not possible and feasible for me.
20:22:
I think perhaps there's no discussion for the night, I'll close the group early.
20:23:
Also wanted to make an announcement. I'll share episodes for tomorrow and day after but I have to complete my income tax returns and so won't be able to moderate and participate in the group discussion. We will take a 2 day break and resume discussions on Sunday

Here‚Äôs a show for you‚Ä¶ Nikola Tesla episode of Historical Figures

13:29:
$CD:
I did not truly understand the contribution of Tesla to our daily life till I heard this podcast. Just a subtle reminder that we need to celebrate the right heroes and use the platform to discuss the contribution of many such important personalities.

The Happiness Lab looks at happiness, the emotion, as a science and it brings forward important questions about our understanding of our minds and this complex emotion.

The group is open for discussions. We'll discuss till 8pm today
16:07:
$K:
Hey guys hope you all are doing well !
Let's have a productive time discussing the podcast topic
16:20:
Just had a random question for you'll
What is happiness to you?
16:26:
$D1:
Hi I just completed my jee prep and I got nit  but now I'm not getting what to do its like I've accomplished all and my learning curve is declined
16:45:
$N7:

That sounds so good
16:47:
$C8:

Which branch?
16:47:
$D1:

What sounds good my learning curve has declined u used to study 8 hrs in coaching and 3 hrs in home but now it's almost zero I bought Udemy course but can't complete it
16:48:

IT
16:48:
$C8:

Make daily timetable
16:49:
$D8:

Happiness , essentially for me is made up of small moments , everyday, for the rest of your life.
It's the state where you want yourself to be a little bit better than yesterday, and are hopeful of an even better tomorrow.

Like when i discovered this group, what i felt was utmost happiness in the form of gratitude, towards $C and $D , towards all of you who keep this beautiful thing going ,and make my day a tiny bit better.
So, if I were to define happiness, it's right here, right now, this moment.
‚ù§Ô∏è
16:49:
$D1:

Ok
16:49:
$C8:

Wow congratsü•≥
16:50:
$A2:

Something like this was felt by $S3P11 as well. He climbed the highest mountain peak in the world and then he felt that I am not as happy as I thought I should be. And this is something that happens with all of us.

As an engineer to one emerging engineer, you have started great. Once you will be in college, you will realize what this are of importance and how to deal with them. So, just be positive :)
16:50:

Completing my daily task before time and using the rest of the time watching instagram feeds and youtube contentsüòÅ
16:51:
$D1:

YesüòÉ
16:52:
$E8:

Yes ... ranveer's podcast with $S3P12
16:53:
Hey , @$K can you plz disable 1 min slow mode , it destroys the flow...10 or 20s is fine
16:54:
$F8:
According to me satisfaction is happiness
17:03:
$K:

Awesome
17:03:

What is satisfaction? How do you define it?
17:03:
Is it satisfaction or is it peace?
17:04:
$C8:

ThanksüòÖüòÄ
17:06:
$K:

Greatful üôèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è
17:09:
$F8:

Satisfaction is something when you felt enough of everything what you have .... Or u got what you want....
17:10:
$K:

So you call it accomplishment of certain thing?
17:11:
$F8:
Ya.... Not only things it's about emotions also....
17:11:
$K:
We humans are not satisfied when we get something easily in hand
17:12:
$M5:

üíØüíØ
17:12:
$K:
Real satisfaction comes when you put your blood for getting it
17:13:
$F8:
Not easily but by putting efforts.... And then getting that in my life makes me feel happy
17:13:
$K:

Great
17:17:
$F8:
But ya when I want something and I got that without efforts as a gift from my parents or someone else I get satisfied.... Because I Only want that at that time.. Nothing more or nothing less.....and that satisfaction without any efforts brings happiness to me
17:18:
So I think satisfaction is not always fulfilled by putting blood
17:19:
$K5:

17:19:
$S:
@$K @$I Please Disable the Slowmode and Bring it to 30 sec it is really So annoying and If We want to type More it Really disturbs Bro Hope you understood the Problem
17:19:
$K:

What if you expect it from them and then don't get it?
17:20:
$S:

Please Bro Please Do the needful
17:25:
$I:

Yes I understood the problem ,but the thing is to make discussion more productive way slow mode enabled
17:30:
$S:

Bro But Just Limit it to 30s If its Possibe so that discussion would be more Productive....
17:30:
$K:

We don't have any problem with it
17:30:
Will make it to 15
17:30:
Okay it's 10 secs now
17:31:
$S:
Thanks @$K
17:31:
$K:
We will need to make it same as before if there is unnecessary spam
17:31:

No worries
17:34:
$V7:

Happiness for me , in addition to or apart from how it's usually defined , is a state of feeling good , feeling good about ourselves in particular , even this sense of accomplishment is meaningful only because it makes us think of our own self in a brighter light , doing good to others and other good deeds give us happiness , because again , it makes us beleive that we are nice. Being around those who love us , because their love and care makes us love ourselves , we feel worthy.
So in my opinion , happiness boils down to feeling greatt about ourselves.
17:37:
$F8:
We humans never use to get satisfied from anything that's why we still have not gained real happiness ..
17:38:

Now thats your expectations.... Not satisfaction.... By the way expectations hearts most of the time
17:39:
So we should try to expect less from anyone
17:39:
$K:
Not less
17:39:
We should not expect anything
17:39:
Anytime
17:41:
$V7:

From anything or anyone , agreed
17:41:
$F8:
Ya .... If we can do that... Then we should do that
17:41:
$K:
I have been doing it since past 3 months
17:42:
It's the best practice I am ever doing
17:43:
It goes tough for few days then it's good
17:44:
$G8:

but isnt difficult ...becoz if we are doing something for the peeson n that person is not at all thnkful ,then it hurts.
