Unapologetic, Unadulterated, and absolutely Uncompromising. Greetings, Brothers and Sisters, from around the world, and welcome back to the home, the haven, the stronghold, and the everlasting super fortress of intelligence Black thought.

My name is Vince, and I am a Black American. üá∫üá∏ 

Foundational Black American. üá∫üá∏


@Fxxxxxxxxe I love watching that Wishbone offense from back then. Dwight Stephenson at center was a beast!


@txxxxxxxxxd That‚Äôs good to know.


I hope Delta Dental is a good insurance to have.


Some of these bowl names are hilarious. 

Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl?
New Era Pinstripe Bowl?
San Diego County Credit Union Holiday Bowl?
Tropical Smoothie Caf√© Frisco Bowl?

üòÇü§£


I didn‚Äôt know Montgomery, AL is hosting a bowl game (TaxAct Camellia Bowl).


Welp, Auburn won‚Äôt have to travel far for their bowl game (Birmingham Bowl).


@txxxxxxxxxxd Please do.


Gotta defend yourself. Damn a dog. https://t.co/4LLjvZqFzo


Where did Alabama fall to after losing to Texas A&M? They fell to #5, right?


Roll Tide, y‚Äôall.


@NxxxxxxxB Sorry to hear that.


I wish YouTube wouldn‚Äôt have gotten rid of the dislike numbers. It‚Äôs good to respect the power of social media, and see what the people are saying.


The Cussing Pastor (who lives in Memphis) has been exposing a lot of people tied in to the Young Dolph murder.


I‚Äôve been seeing quite a few cars around OKC driving at night without their lights on lately. What‚Äôs going on?


@Txxxxxxxe She looks like she‚Äôs about to eat her lunch. 

Then Kuntmala next.


@mxxxxxxxxxi @Yxxxxxe It‚Äôs private now; I never got a chance to hear it. I hate when he does that lol.


Enes Kanter is one of the anti-Black immigrants that Dr. Claud Anderson warned us about two decades ago.


@Lxxxxxxxxxx2 It starts at noon on CBS. I guess it depends on which game CBS desides to air in your area.


@mxxxxxxxxxi @Yxxxxxe I bet it‚Äôs a good one.


I didn‚Äôt know Grambling got a new football coach (Hue Jackson). What happened to the last guy? He‚Äôs had a bunch of success there.


@txxxxxxxxxxd Yep, I still remember when they did it to you. I‚Äôm sure nothing happened to them neither.


@_xxxxxxxxxxg That bastard!


Damn, Chicago!


I wonder if Grand Crew on NBC will be a good show.


@_xxxxxxxxxxg @Cxxxxxxxxx_ I forgot about that lol. I might need to watch the first season again.


Car washes are cool.


@_xxxxxxxxxxg @Cxxxxxxxxx_ Yeah, I assume they‚Äôre filming it now.


@_xxxxxxxxxxg @Cxxxxxxxxx_ They did say they‚Äôre coming back for another season.


@_xxxxxxxxxxg I‚Äôm ready for season two to start.


Look at Byron Allen lol. https://t.co/rDlEf3kY9e


I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm so bad at finishing books.


They actually moved downstairs, almost directly under. https://t.co/qkBFQ1DmWT


@Lxxxxxxxxxx2 Why does he watch that coon?


I bet Rick James put on some good concerts back in the day.


@Lxxxxxxxxxx2 Charge it.


I saw another one tonight and one last night. https://t.co/bgoRbiBjcY


@Exxxxxxxxxxxxxk I don‚Äôt think so. Some of the residents are supposed to get payouts.


@kxxxxxxxe I love it!


@kxxxxxxxe It‚Äôs supposed to get up to 80¬∞ here next Wednesday.


@Txxxxxxxxxx0 Right, that was insane.


@Txxxxxxxxxx0 This must‚Äôve been what Tariq was talking about to that Latino dude in that space on Twitter the other day, about how crime ridden Puerto Rico is, and that he needs to fix his homeland before he criticizes Black Americans.


@Lxxxxxxxxxx2 He‚Äôs not bad when he just stick to sports.


@xxxxxxxxxxxxn They must make them well, to last that long.


Caller from area code 404, what‚Äôs your name, and where are you calling from?


Tariq spent too much time on that Dante dude last night. I would‚Äôve hung up within 2 minutes on his dumb-playin‚Äô ass.


@Dxxxxxxxl Well dang lol.


@Dxxxxxxxl Another Broken Egg is good.


I want a bed liner for my truck. Why it didn‚Äôt come with one, I have no idea.


@Txxxxxxxe True. I wanna see his emails, letters, voicemails, and telegrams lol.


@Txxxxxxxe I wanted them to win, but I guess the Raiders needed it, considering what they‚Äôve gone through this season.


That was Ole Miss‚Äô first 10-win regular season in üèà program history?! Damn!


@Axxxxxxxxxxxxxy Yeah, it wasn‚Äôt so bad. The scoring part is weird, though.


I learned how to play spades tonight. I even won once.


@Pxxxxxxxxxxxxh Too many people (especially Black people) don‚Äôt know that. I be telling folks to be careful who they celebrate.


@Dxxxxxxxl I wouldn‚Äôt call it a brunch spot, but Walton‚Äôs Southern Table off Whitesburg and Airport Rd is really good.


@Lxxxxxxxxxxxxxn Nope.


@Axxxxxxxxxxxxxy Yep. I remember when he was at New Orleans.


I forgot all about Jimmy Graham.


Is there an all-Black ref staff in this game?


@Mxxxxxxxxxxxxt Right.


@dxxxxxxxxxxxx5 A voice that has some sense.


@oxxxxxxxxxxxx3 Right, he can‚Äôt even be Black 1st after a strong, catastrophic killing happened to his son. Sad.


A Black owned store at Quail Springs Mall that I loved (Afric Way) isn‚Äôt there anymore. I am so pissed. I bought my soap from them.


How many defeated bootlicks are in this clip? https://t.co/0eCNn7qfye


@Lxxxxxxxh Right, that would be horrendous.


I didn‚Äôt realize that Druski dude was so popular. He‚Äôs on commercials now lol.


I saw this today and thought, this can‚Äôt be real lol. https://t.co/i2tnPHGzpB


@lxxxxxxxxI I did.


It looks like they‚Äôre shipping out another strand of COVID. I swear the pandemic ended about 3 times and they keep bringing it back lol. 
Cock-suckers.


@Rxxxxxxxxxxxz Chucks and pearls. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


Looks like Tariq‚Äôs wife is having a girl. Pretty cool.


@LxxxxxxxxT There‚Äôs some nice ones on that side. I like the older houses with basements.


I just saw a 2016 GMC Sierra 2500 HD for sale with 218k miles on it. They racked them miles up fast!


@LxxxxxxxxT I felt like that when I visited last month.


@Mxxxxxxx0 Reason #38 why I‚Äôm glad I did not vote for this administration.


She better come with a Black agenda. https://t.co/KdjqRX6S8i


Wow, LSU beat Texas A&M.


Oklahoma State is dismantling.


I‚Äôm ready for the 2nd season of The Upshaw‚Äôs to start on Netflix.


I hope South Carolina beats Clemson.


I need a cigarette.


Wow, what a game!


Bama‚Äôs defense has really stepped up tonight.


I‚Äôm listening to the Iron Bowl on the radio, and it sounds like Alabama‚Äôs offensive line ain‚Äôt doing shit.


@Ixxxxxxxxxxxxa Do you like it out there?


@Ixxxxxxxxxxxxa They did that at a gas station in California when I was there.


@Kxxxxxxxxxxxxn Just ride around without getting out of the car.


@RxxxxxX This must be how all the swirling in Oklahoma starts. Gotta reel ‚Äòem in lol.


@bxxxxxxxx_ Yeah, it‚Äôs a good one.


Saban was right, we‚Äôre just happy to win a game. 

#RollTide
#IronBowl


@xxxxxxxxxxxxn That‚Äôs a shame.


I hate that Kountry Wayne went on Vlad. Black folks ain‚Äôt fuckin‚Äô with Vlad anymore. Get on code, dude!


I had no idea Candace Parker was married to a woman.


I‚Äôm gonna have to take my F-150 back to the Ford dealer. It‚Äôs still using oil after the TSB for it has been done.


@_xxxxxxxx1 Yeah, he‚Äôs hilarious.


Here‚Äôs a throwback #FuckYouFriday from #TheCussingPastor about spending your money wisely during this holiday season. https://t.co/8GsYHtBEOQ


Forgive me for being late, but why do people say ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go, Brandon‚Äù when Jim Crow Joe is brought up?


I thought warm weather on Christmas was a new thing. My dad is 58 and said he remembers experiencing warm-weather Christmas holidays when he was a kid. He grew up in Birmingham/Ensley, but it still gets cold there.


@Sxxxxxxxxxxxxxn Or brown..


@hxxxxxxxxxxe Sorry about your loss.


@Lxxxxxxxxxx2 Girl, stop.


Ed Orgeron would be a great voice actor.


@Txxxxxxxe She‚Äôs a callous peckerwood.


@Hxxxxxxxxc Cool.


I love watching videos of recorded road trips on YouTube. I like to see the highlights of the journey.


@cxxxxxxxxxxxd Yeah, it died all the way down.


@DxxxxxxxxxI Perhaps.


@xxxxxxxxxxb So much for getting it on time for Christmas.


How come nobody tweets in Tutnese anymore?


Trying Potbelly‚Äôs for the first time.


@xxxxxxxxxxb I‚Äôd be so pissed.


@txxxxxxxxxxxe Save me a plate.


@Kxxxxxxxxxxr It‚Äôs a damn shame. I had to tell someone a while back to not say that. She told me we‚Äôre supposed to stand for people as Christians ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I‚Äôm a Christian too, but I‚Äôm not gonna feed a starving child across the street before I feed my own.


@Hxxxxxxxxc üëãüèæ Is your music on Spotify?


It‚Äôs sad that you have to convince so many Black folks to keep us first (only focus on us) and not include other groups, because other groups don‚Äôt include us. https://t.co/fdfPjdeT9K


@Txxxxxxxxxxxxs My Christmas wish is for y‚Äôall to push for protections and reparations exclusively for Foundational Black Americans/Descendants of American Slaves.


@bxxxxxxxxxxe Now we know. Shit, I might start saying it too lol.


@_xxxxxxxxxxg Absolutely.


@Rxxxxxxxxxxy Are you trying to gain white people‚Äôs approval by saying that Black people are our own worst enemy? If so, you‚Äôre a Sambo.


@_xxxxxxxxxxg Go Vols!


I wish these bowl games were on local channels.


@xxxxxxxxxxb Oh, you have time then lol.


@xxxxxxxxxxb Hurry, you have one more day.


@Nxxxxxxxxxxxx1 Damn, I did not know that.


My phone already knows lol. https://t.co/OT5Q3POCa6


I‚Äôm about to start weight loss journey #12.


Lol so that‚Äôs why. https://t.co/Q9oclblRCC https://t.co/sqrMbAoabO


@Wxxxxxxxxxn How many $5 Indians is it going to?


@bxxxxxxxxxx5 Me too, and I‚Äôm only 31. I‚Äôve been watching those shows since elementary school.


It‚Äôd be cool to get the B1 logo Professor Black Truth uses, put on the back window of my truck. https://t.co/HdF7lbfxSw


It‚Äôs amazing when you look back at old episodes of All in the Family, Sanford and Son, The Jeffersons, etc. and see how raw tv was back in the day. Those shows touched on race, gender, and sexuality that would make the new humans scream.


@_xxxxxxxx1 I do. I don‚Äôt remember her on Diff‚Äôrent Strokes, though.


@Lxxxxxxxxxx2 That‚Äôs my little soldier!


Thanks, everybody.

Merry Christmas from the future White‚Äôs!

Even the older white dudes know what ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù is and how to use it in the proper context lol. https://t.co/tS8nKWPfxA


@bxxxxxxxxxx5 They did. I have a bunch of them on DVD. https://t.co/XFXmJkFMZD


Professor Black Truth gave @oxxxxxxxxxxxx3 a shoutout today. 

B1 Salute


To all the women who had a crush on DeVon Franklin, you can shoot your shot now. 

Fellas, you can now shoot your shot at Meagan Good.


@Lxxxxxxxxxx2 I read that damn book for nothin‚Äô.


@Txxxxxxxe He‚Äôs getting his negro wake up call.


The Black folks that disagree about us being owed reparations are the same ones that would chase their cousins down if they stole $100 from them.


@Rxxxxxxxxxxxxxr Thanks.


@mxxxxxxxa It really is. I was just there in October. It‚Äôs grown a lot.


@mxxxxxxxa Yeah, my dad finished AAMU in ‚Äò87 and stayed in Huntsville. She followed him there after they married.


@mxxxxxxxa Lol from Bessemer to Huntsville.


Shoutout to this Blackman that called in to the Paul Finebaum Show shortly after a caller was talking about how catastrophic the Holocaust was. The Brother also reminded us that slavery was bad and not that long ago. https://t.co/9xjD2VK4pR


My parents have been married for 32 years today (Dec. 16th, 1989; Bessemer, AL). https://t.co/fIgZ8HKlDL


@Txxxxxxxxxxxxxl I‚Äôm sure Michael Eric Dyson will kiss her ass too.


@Txxxxxxxxxxxxr Then why did you post a RIP about her?


@Rxxxxxxxxxxxx1 @Gxxxxxxe Right. Black folks got Biden in, and this is how he‚Äôs thanking the Black folks that voted for him.


@Txxxxxxxe Fuck him with somebody else‚Äôs dick.


I hope Deion Sanders gets a lot of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è recruits.


I‚Äôm glad that college football athletes are finally starting to get the freedom and PAY that should‚Äôve been had.


I‚Äôm with Scotty on this one.

I wonder how Ollie from Last Chance U is doing.


@txxxxxxxxxxxn Check it out.


You won‚Äôt find a better R&B playlist than mine!

https://t.co/uojUmpOIWr


@Txxxxxxxe Ohhhh. I guess the WNBA turned her out.


@Txxxxxxxe Oh ok, I always thought she was married to a man; I just never seen him lol.


@Zxxxxx2 I stay in OKC too. I agree.


It‚Äôs supposed to be a high of 75¬∞ here on Christmas Day.


@_xxxxxxxn Skee Wee!


Kamala‚Äôs bootlick constituency is probably loving that dumbass sassy bounce she does. https://t.co/3myl2Xa5me


@Txxxxxxxxxxxr You know those Biden Butt Kissers are all for it, especially in a state that he won.


I didn‚Äôt know they were having a bowl game on Christmas.


@cxxxxxxxxxxx5 White supremacy are the roots of those groups.


@Txxxxxxxe I never knew of that until today.


Latinx? https://t.co/Xmj4yXu26h

@Jxxxxxxxxxxw Ensley, AL


@Zxxxxx2 Oh yeah, I know it.


@Zxxxxx2 Thanks, I might need to add Bricktown to my list too.


@Zxxxxx2 No, I didn‚Äôt. I was busy driving this lol. https://t.co/zYamj8LHjk


@Lxxxxxxxxxx2 You better be.


@Zxxxxx2 No, we went to Yukon. I still want to go to Chickasha to see the lights there too.


I had a good time looking at Christmas lights tonight.


Go Saints!


Damn, the Ravens had that super-long drive for nothing.


As a whole, the Boul√©, Greeks, Links, Masons, and Eastern Star has been selling Black people out for decades.


Go UAB Blazers!


@pxxxxxx6 @Pxxxxxxxxxxxxx4 Yeah, a lot of mom‚Äôs side is from there. Well, Greensboro and Bessemer.


I hate that Jackson State lost. They got too much positive notoriety the past few days to go out like that.


@txxxxxx4 Yeah, they‚Äôre so full of shit.


@Txxxxxxxe Right. She doesn‚Äôt even like Jim Crow Joe. She‚Äôs only defending him to save herself.


We can‚Äôt afford to lose our truckers from walking off the job. Leave them alone. https://t.co/jUQnaNvLvt
