Hope you all are in good health. 
As you know, you need different components and tool to perform Linear Circuit Analysis Lab. So, your labs properly start when you join university again.
So, I want all of you to work on MULTISIM software for analyzing different parameters in circuit like current, voltages etc. Choose complex combinational circuit and verify basic electrical law like KCL, KVL etc.
As simulation part is also included in your final lab exam, so you should learn it now. I will share some task with you as well on Monday. So, install MULTISIM software till Monday if anyone still don’t have it.
Stay at home and be safe.
Thanks.

Dear students, ,

I hope you guys are fine and following the guidelines as laid out by the government and the medical experts. 

HEC has asked all technically advanced universities (like SEECS, NUST, GIKI, LUMS, IST, FAST, BAHRIA, CUST etc) to continue the semester via online education. For other universities that are not technically advanced, a break has been given to students till 30th May so that in that time university develops capabilities to start online classes. In any case, all universities will be initiating online education by 30th May as proper class room education might start from Fall semester (due to the current crisis).

We at IST had started the online classes since the first off-week. It is because we are trying our best to minimize your time loss. We understand that online education is not a substitute of actual class education but these are exceptional circumstances and we have to cope up with these together. Students also need to step up and help each other out in understanding the contents. Faculty is added in each class watsApp group so that you can ask questions whenever you go through the lecture.

We ensure that the lectures are uploaded in advance. We recommend that you follow your time table and watch the lectures accordingly. Faculty will go an extra mile in helping you and answering your queries. You have books, its best time you read them thoroughly. 

Please help each other out. We as a nation have come out of tougher challenges than this. This also shall pass. 

Best regards
31/03/2020, 5:29 pm - $B: Message by HoD (EE)

In continuation to my previous message, I would like to add few more things (that will be more clear within a couple of weeks):

1. Assesments will be carried out mostly via assignments/home quizzes and a final exam. 

2. If the classes resume by 30th May, then we will probably have final exam by mid/end June. 

3. We are devising a mechanism for labs that will be communicated to you within a couple of weeks.

4. Financial issues (hostel, transport fee etc) will be sorted out by the adminstration and that will be adjusted in your next fee.

5. For the final year students, please keep working on your FYPs (as you guys did during last summer / spring break). More time will be given to you after university opens to finish and fine tune the work before your defense.

6. Remeber these are extra ordinary circumstances, so better utilize your time in learning new skills. These are not vacations. Act maturely. You are not school students any more.

7. We will keep you updated regrding any new developments. For now please focus on your lectures and try helping each other out.
