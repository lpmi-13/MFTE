@sxxxxy I’m such a lush!


@sxxxxy You know me so well! 
I’ve found a passion fruit Martini!
So beautiful!!


@sxxxxy Yep, waiting in for Amazon parcels!🤦🏽‍♀️


@sxxxxy I had a great time over the weekend and have two weeks off helps 😊


@sxxxxy Are you sure…. No shame if you were! 
Promise!😂😂🤦🏽‍♀️


@sxxxxy Oh gosh I’m so not a drinker!😂😂🤦🏽‍♀️
I clearly need to do a public apology for my drunken behaviour! And in bed by 11!😂😂🤦🏽‍♀️


@Axxxxxxxxp No can’t use this as it’s not my parcel.
All I want is to say I delivered parcel to correct address but no one there so left outside home by bins.I’ve taken pictures. They have cameras outside their home.


@Axxxxxxxxp As I said I no longer have the parcel


@sxxxxy So funny!


@Axxxxxxxxp Doesn’t help as I don’t have tracking number as it’s not my parcel .


@AxxxxxxK complaint about a delivery  to my home, left on doorstep and it wasn’t even my parcel!
Could someone get back to me please.


@sxxxxy I’m so tired!!  I’m not use to alcohol and staying out after 10!!!


@sxxxxy I’ve felt ill all day!🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️


@kxxxxxxxxe This is Urticaria. Histamine response to hot, cold, pressure .. it will not go away with a soap🤦🏽‍♀️


@Fxxxxx1 Sponge and cream I’m afraid x


@Fxxxxx1 Anytime 😊🥳


@sxxxxy Blooming Cheeky!!!


@sxxxxy Well I thought as I’m going out to eat the food would soak up the alcohol 😂 not sure it will 🥳😉


I’m drunk… I’m so sorry 😂 https://t.co/uKOSYbm8fr


@sxxxxy I have already drank my weight! …. That is a considerable amount of Gin!

I’ve just informed them that’s is quite funny that it took less than 20 seconds to leave my account, would I bust @Sxxxxxxxxs  Westbromwich again ?…. Nope.


So left two messages and the branch said they can’t refund! Then someone else came on the line and said yes so I have my money back.
Message from spec-savers just now asking me to let them know when I get my refund to let them know. It takes up to  10 days 🤦🏽‍♀️


@sxxxxy I could have moved in to be fed, watered and the occasional belly rub… not quite sure I’d get over the fence without a ladder though!!😂😂🤦🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🙄

@sxxxxy Do you think that’s learned  behaviour?…… just asking😂😂


@Pxxxxxxxxl I think more telling was her response.. really quite telling.. by handing it to someone else she validated his assumption, she was called out and her face said it all. To be honest she’s not very good anyway.


@sxxxxy @Axxxx You two must be the silliest pair I know! …. 😃

@sxxxxy Bloody hell! Note to self … always read your tweet before you send it!!


@sxxxxy 😂😂😂🤦🏽‍♀️NO harm!!!!!


@sxxxxy I think we all came into nursing to care for our patients, Drs also so I think we all should have the vaccine… not quite sure what happens if you medically can’t have the vaccine!


@sxxxxy It really will! Id expect a few to hand their notice in I’m sure!

Compulsory COVID-19 jabs announced for NHS nursing staff https://t.co/2z3zng8ztr


@sxxxxy Also in NY they said something like 30,000 police would walk out as not wanting the vaccine … reality something like 30 officers were put on leave.


@sxxxxy I think many are governed by their family.. but we do have a duty of care and if having a vaccine helps our patients staying safe, ourselves also then we should. As for a mass walk out, that’s not going to happen, we still have to pay our mortgage, rent and gas bills!


@sxxxxy There are always those that even if they are educated are swayed by the rubbish put out on media platforms about the vaccine. nurses, work with evidence based practice and the evidence does show that the vaccine helps.. with other things such as washing hands and masks….


@Axxxx @sxxxxy 😂😂😂absolutely not!! I have far more followers than that!!!


@sxxxxy Don’t be silly 😊


@Dxxxxxxxxxxxt Thought so 💖

@Txxxxxxxxxxxn @WxxxxxX @Wxxxxxxe Well went on their website and it won’t upload my complaint! So fancy that @Wxxxxxxe shoddy from start to finish! Clearly the abuse of women  are still not taken seriously.


@Wxxxxxxe please read! https://t.co/4gaa6sTR1M


@Txxxxxxxxxxxn @WxxxxxX @Wxxxxxxe I was so mad and tired! Thought it looked wrong!


Called 111, not a clue.. don’t know why police didn’t speak to the abused woman in my house. 
With the first call I’d have to ask if all information documented properly or did they forget to check with the victim!!??🤷🏽‍♀️


@WxxxxxX police called , came spoke to husband. I have no idea where the husband is and the wife had injuries but left after the police didn’t bother to see her and speak to her. Not sure what’s going on but no due care to this poor woman!
