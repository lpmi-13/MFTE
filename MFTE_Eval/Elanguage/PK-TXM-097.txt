21/03/2020, 5:10 pm - 
21/03/2020, 5:13 pm - $A: I have raised this issue in the meeting that the lab activities are practical and even with modifying we need to assess of the objectives of the course are being achieved or not.

Live interactive medium presents different challenges. Zoom meetings don't go beyond 40 min and students may come up with variety of reasons to not be there. We have seen Dr $S3P1's email about the issues Karachi campus faced
21/03/2020, 5:15 pm - $A: That's the reason I went ahead with these two tasks so we can assess and get feedback from the students and see what strategy we can adopt for the weeks ahead if the situation continues.
21/03/2020, 8:07 pm - $B: Ma'am, what kind of a worksheet are we supposed to design to evaluate students understanding of survey?
21/03/2020, 8:22 pm - $A: I will share a worksheet sample that I designed when I was teaching BBA students and it was on the video on Non-verbal communication of Key figures (you would have seen that as it was one of the links when we looked at Non-verbal communication)
21/03/2020, 8:22 pm - $B: Okay.
21/03/2020, 8:29 pm - $A: 
21/03/2020, 8:30 pm - $A: Have a look, we can base the worksheet on 2-3 resources. We will not be grading these.
21/03/2020, 8:30 pm - $A: These are required as our mode of teaching has changed
22/03/2020, 3:53 pm - $C: I have one query regarding next week
22/03/2020, 3:58 pm - $A: Sure let me know
22/03/2020, 4:12 pm - $C: No, actually its clarified from your previous email. Thank you
22/03/2020, 4:14 pm - $D: Yeah, the email got all the detail along with the week 9 plan. What I want to know is that are we all using Slate for announcements and WhatsApp groups for conducting the activities? @92*****
22/03/2020, 4:16 pm - $D: Like, can I make a video in which I tell the students about our activities and how we are going to do them and that they are supposed to get online on their lab time?
22/03/2020, 4:18 pm - $A: If you use WhatsApp groups you should also upload materials on slate too in case any student is not part of the group or the department wants to know where the resources are in the case any student complains about that
22/03/2020, 4:20 pm - $A: You can do that but I would discourage live streaming due to issues associated. 

For this week my suggestion would be to upload materials a day before and tell students what they are supposed to do. Then in the lab time they can ask you questions on your chosen platform
22/03/2020, 4:21 pm - $A: I would like to take everyone's perspective on the attendance aspect. What do you suggest

-mark attendance when students submit work (worksheet + listening quiz) 

-have to be online and attend a q/a session 

- or any other option
22/03/2020, 4:21 pm - $A: Let's have a uniform policy across the board
22/03/2020, 4:22 pm - $C: My query was pertaining to this that is the time for their queries independent of lab time or is the class time the time we answer queries and they can take the quiz any time depending on their convenience?
22/03/2020, 4:23 pm - $C: I think the first one is the most fair criterion since that also ensures their evaluation output (for future if the online classes continue) for being online for q/a not sure how many students outside isb would manage connectivity at the stipulated time
22/03/2020, 4:25 pm - $C: We could maybe come up with any additional criterion too for attendance to ensure each student worked for it by themselves and not just copying or taking help from others. Like maybe a self evaluative "this week I learned.. " paragraph on self assessment which every student submits individually via email and then we mark them present.
22/03/2020, 4:25 pm - $B: I would like to go with the first option too.
22/03/2020, 4:25 pm - $D: Got it.
22/03/2020, 4:26 pm - $E: For this week i think the first one suits more. From the next week, we can have live interactive sessions.
22/03/2020, 4:27 pm - $D: Ma'am, it won't be live streaming rather a recorded video that would explain the tasks.
22/03/2020, 4:28 pm - $D: Ma'am, when they submit their tasks. I guess that's best as it would let us know who is taking it seriously and who isn't.
22/03/2020, 4:28 pm - $C: @92****
22/03/2020, 4:28 pm - $D: The same query I got.
22/03/2020, 4:29 pm - $D: Live sessions would be tough and hectic to deal with, I guess.
22/03/2020, 4:30 pm - $A: My concern with this suggestion is that students wouldn't be serious and they would question why they have a written task
22/03/2020, 4:30 pm - $E: But i think, some lab works may require live interactive session since a few students need more explanation to comprehend the directions.
22/03/2020, 4:30 pm - $A: Yes and students would end up complaining about it to the department
22/03/2020, 4:30 pm - $D: Hmmm
22/03/2020, 4:31 pm - $A: I want to ensure that for this week we explore tools and see what feedback we receive from the students and the department
22/03/2020, 4:31 pm - $E: Secondly i need to mention, i haven't done panel discussion activity with students as well.
22/03/2020, 4:31 pm - $D: Right, Maam. Some of them have gone back to their villages.
22/03/2020, 4:31 pm - $A: Thank you for updating. I thought you had.
22/03/2020, 4:32 pm - $E: I do not have SLATE account. So i intend to upload relevant material on Google classroom or Edmodo
22/03/2020, 4:32 pm - $C: True making it mandatory could be a problem but how do we ensure all of them duly watching the resources and taking the listening quiz for themselves
22/03/2020, 4:32 pm - $A: That would work
22/03/2020, 4:32 pm - $E: Students requested me to take it after mids.
22/03/2020, 4:32 pm - $F: For the attendance, I think the first option is good to go.
22/03/2020, 4:32 pm - $C: Yes two of my sections are greatly comprised of hostelites
22/03/2020, 4:33 pm - $D: üíØ
22/03/2020, 4:33 pm - $E: Ma'am you can explore Socrative
22/03/2020, 4:33 pm - $E: It is used for formative assessments
22/03/2020, 4:33 pm - $A: I will have a look at that and see if that's a workable platform
22/03/2020, 4:34 pm - $A: That's the case with most of us
22/03/2020, 4:34 pm - $F: I agree.
22/03/2020, 4:35 pm - $A: They will have to make the questionnaire and they wouldn't be able to do that without looking at the resources.
22/03/2020, 4:35 pm - $C: There's something Sir $S3P1 shared as well in email
22/03/2020, 4:35 pm - $C: Google launched a service teachfromhome
22/03/2020, 4:35 pm - $C: But then again the limitation is students' connectivity
22/03/2020, 4:35 pm - $E: Sure. It may have a feature of adding audio and relevant question. It adds the answer key in it too. It could be teacher paced which can minimize plagiarizing
22/03/2020, 4:36 pm - $F: Even the internet link gets down time and again here. So the students in villages will have problems probably.
22/03/2020, 4:36 pm - $A: That is great! Leme see that. Thank you for suggesting.
22/03/2020, 4:37 pm - $A: So ours wouldn't the only course this would be an issue across the board with rest of the subjects. So the department would have to assess this aspect once they receive feedback from teachers and students
22/03/2020, 4:38 pm - $C: Yes that is my concern with worksheet too. I was planning to make it more like the coursera and online mooc quizes which assess whether you were listening to information in that particular part of video resource using multiple choice questions
22/03/2020, 4:38 pm - $C: Maybe our worksheets being more meticulously designed could help as well
22/03/2020, 4:39 pm - $E: Dear ma'am, can you explain the final project? Since i missed the last meeting.
22/03/2020, 4:39 pm - $A: I am looking at Google tools, why don't all of us explore those  and see if that could use be a workable solution.

Dr $S3P1 mentioned Q/A interactive session in Google Slides option. I was looking at YouTube to see that
22/03/2020, 4:39 pm - $C: Sure. Let me see if I can understand it properly today and I'll share
22/03/2020, 4:40 pm - $D: üëçüèº
22/03/2020, 4:40 pm - $A: Even then the chance of them sharing it with friends would be there.
22/03/2020, 4:41 pm - $D: Ma'am, it's not possible to eliminate this factor of sharing answers as it can only happen in a live session. They got their cell phone etc
22/03/2020, 4:41 pm - $A: The final project will be based on Action Steps 1-5 

Research based in which either interview and survey will be a research tool
22/03/2020, 4:42 pm - $C: True ü§ï I guess that is a persistent element of online classes minus live sessions #teacher'sdilemma
22/03/2020, 4:43 pm - $D: üíØ
22/03/2020, 4:44 pm - $A: True. Live streaming wouldn't be a viable option and ours is a more practical based work in which students do the work. Online presents us with a lot of challenges and problems
22/03/2020, 4:45 pm - $A: Students will be working in groups of 3 and we were supposed to have the assignments based on these steps in the class

Now we would have to see if that to go ahead with.
22/03/2020, 4:45 pm - $A: *if that is what we will go ahead with.
22/03/2020, 4:47 pm - $C: Can we also try work around it in this way that we break down our activities into steps which they have to submit within a small window of time to ensure most of them are doing it?
22/03/2020, 4:49 pm - $A: That's a viable solution. What's the time frame would you suggest?
22/03/2020, 4:53 pm - $C: For example the listening quiz is broken down into smaller sections. And students are informed that time of submission of section one is within half an hour. Then we inform them of the next task etc. 
Also, this could be negotiated with the students that what is the best time of internet connectivity for them when its not too taxed like morning perhaps to minimize any discrepancies in running it step by step
22/03/2020, 4:58 pm - $A: They would end up staying midnight. Breaking activities wouldn't be a bad option but they would take all that time just reading and watching/ not watching the resources and would have excuses as to why they can't work in real time. 

Let's assess of we can work around such issues.
22/03/2020, 8:24 pm - $B: Ma'am, I have a question regarding worksheet. Can we give them a topic and ask them to design five questions on it. One demographic, two open ended and two close ended ones?
22/03/2020, 8:27 pm - $A: You will be asking them to make a questionnaire as a task. So that can be a preliminary activity.

Will this be the only activity or there will be others based on the resources ?
22/03/2020, 8:28 pm - $B: There are other activities too.
22/03/2020, 8:28 pm - $B: I have made 4 questions in total.
22/03/2020, 8:28 pm - $B: There are true and false and other such questions too.
22/03/2020, 8:29 pm - $A: That would be great!

As a follow-up do ask them to make a survey on one of the online platforms too.
22/03/2020, 8:29 pm - $B: Okay!!! Thanks!
22/03/2020, 9:13 pm - $G: Important message to all:

Hey
Who among the instructors just sent out an email on slate? My students and I just received an email.

Please opt out the sections and choose only your labs when sending an email. This creates a lot of confusion. Now my students are asking me questions.
22/03/2020, 9:14 pm - $G: 
22/03/2020, 9:14 pm - $G: Here is the email for reference.
22/03/2020, 9:21 pm - $A: It's not a Listening Quiz, it's a Listening Practice Test for the TOFEL based section
22/03/2020, 9:23 pm - $A: That is true, and with students working out different aspects, this may end up panicking them.
22/03/2020, 9:24 pm - $C: I haven't made any announcements yet
22/03/2020, 9:27 pm - $E: I don't have a SLATE account.
22/03/2020, 9:27 pm - $B: I did but I selected the groups.
22/03/2020, 9:36 pm - $B: Let me fix it.
22/03/2020, 9:36 pm - $B: I myself don't know what went wrong
22/03/2020, 9:36 pm - $B: Sorry sorry sorry
22/03/2020, 9:38 pm - $G: Oho No worries $B.

I hope its just an error. Not Slate playing with us. Cuz we all have to send emails in this week.

Or we will have a huge trouble waiting ahead of us ü§ûüòÖ
22/03/2020, 9:38 pm - $A: It's ok. Sometimes this can happen
22/03/2020, 9:39 pm - $G: To avoid confusion, when sending email, I will mention my labs within email content and also mention my signature.
22/03/2020, 9:39 pm - $A: Good that we all got a heads-up
22/03/2020, 9:40 pm - $B: 
22/03/2020, 9:41 pm - $A: Maybe there is come error on SLATE. No worries
22/03/2020, 9:45 pm - $C: Yes it is glitchy sometimes with the visibility of the post
23/03/2020, 8:04 pm - $A: Good Evening,

I hope all of you are well.
