@Mxxxxxxxxxb 2/2 What I find useful is students rotating through clinical placements to identify those various cultures to identify those role models to mould the student to become the professional they aspire to be #MedRadJClub


@Mxxxxxxxxxb 1/2Think it depends on what the student perceives as professional or unprofessional. Students enter a department with a perception of values and behaviours. Often through professional socialisation they quickly mould into the behaviours of that department #MedRadJClub


@Mxxxxxxxxxb There is always that one radiographer you aspire to be. It is how the student grasps the facets of professionalism in the academic sense and see those facets being applied (or not applied) in the clinical environment #MedRadJClub
