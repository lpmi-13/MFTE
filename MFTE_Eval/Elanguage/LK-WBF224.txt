Eng includes Ollie Pope in test team who is not opener.



England will be without Bairstow

Who returned to eng koz ECB's Quote policy on selection,Jos buttler will returns to eng after 1st test so others get chance

Why these Indians make such big deal about players wives?

If something happen same

Tomorrow, india might Draw tomorrow.

So sorry



I removed post which not

Allow by Bada or Admin team


Surely India cannot pull off another heist after the Gabba? Money on England to go 1 up.


What's this all about  Completely irrelevant.


Maybe England had these in mind when they batted on, on day 4. Time will tell whether they were over cautious or whether they made the right decision.



https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-eng-1st-test-england-s-first-test-blues-show-the-dangers-of-declarations-against-india-1250777


Makes sense to me. I think a lot of SL players are also scrud up after marriage and become new daddy.


Anderson gets rid of Gill and Rahane in the same over after Leach got the important wicket of Pujara caught at slip off an excellent delivery. England in the box seat at the moment with India on 104/4.


Is Anda chasing 800?




Anderson on fire, gets Pant caught at short cover by Root. India 110/5


Defo looks like it. He's said he has more years in him.



What a spell today.


India 6 down, the end is near.


Anderson and Broad have very good records in SC.when did this SENA theory apply to them?



Pundey guys like Randy doing it


Anderson has improved his record in Asia over time, but Broad averages about 50 in SL and IND. He's had some success in UAE.


611 test wicket by Classy anderson.

Only 9 wkts Away to beat Kumble (619)


Anderson averages 27.94 in Asia which includes UAE marginally higher than his career average of 26.49. In comparison Broad's average in Asia is 36.31 much higher than his career average of 27.56. Both Anderson and Broad have done well in the UAE averaging in the low 20's.


Ashwin caught behind off Leach breaking the good partnership with Kohli. Now its all up to Kohli, not much batting on the other end. 50 overs remaining, can India hold on?


Ball kept low Stokes clean bowled Virat 72



India about to loose in few minutes



8 down


Bada

Thanks to support both Eng & Ind




Broad has to wait till Day night test

Congratulation Joe Root  for 6th win in Asia out of 6 test under his Captaincy

47 test 26 win over all by root as Captain better than Vaugh & Cook



Cook Had 5 win off 16 test in Asia


192 all out

Eng won by 227 runs 1/0 in the series



Joe Root Man of Match i Guess for his 218


Done and dusted...... England win by 227 runs.


If you take away Root, India would have won


same with SL.



If u take Root's contributions out in both Tests we could have won.


ofa:  ofa:  ofa:  ofa: 

India vs England, 1st Test



England won by 227 runs

ENG - 578 & 178

IND - 337 & 192 (58.1)





Player of the Match

Joe Root





Most Test wins among England captains:

26 Joe Root (47 Tests) *

26 Michael Vaughan (51)

24 Andrew Strauss (50)

24 Alastair Cook (59)

20 Peter May (41)



Virat Kohli has now lost his last four Tests as captain - the most he has lost in succession. In the seven Tests prior to that he had won seven in a row, the longest such sequence for an Indian captain.



Most consecutive wins by visiting sides in Asia

7 Australia (2002-04)

6 England (2018-21)*

No other instances of more than three successive win



Joe Root as captain in Asia: Six Tests | Six wins. Among visiting captains in Asia, only Graeme Smith (eight wins in 21 Tests) and Clive Lloyd (seven in 17) have won more Tests as skipper.



Joe Root | England captain and Player of the Match:


250 by Root we lost by 227 runs but eng bowler too good



Anderson 5 wickets,

Bess 5 wickets

Leach 6 wickets or 5 not sure



They are super bowling side their catching great we depends on Ash/ Bumrah, too much



We need Leggy Axar in next test


Who do we blame for this loss? Kholi's wife? India celebrated too much after Gabba win?




This could work well for SL , everyone can see we gave them the ideal pre Indian tour warm up , just need to reach out to teams touring India and offer our services.


Maybeeee Root, Stokes, Leach, Bess, Jimmy Panda.


If we take away Mendi's contributions SL .... maybe that doesn't work with this.


You miss the point, this is fact 3 indian captain

From Delhi side not remains good captain after sometime.



Under vk we lost 4 test in a row, while he was Captain including today. he missed

Killing Instict when eng bats on 1st day

Kohli blame slow track.


Damn that was great bowling by Anda


No doubt Indians will blame everything under the sun for this defeat. That said, Kohli will be under some pressure after four straight defeats while India won handsomely and showed great fight under Rahane.





Archer ruled out of 2nd test due to an elbow injury.



."




India will use Black Clay to bounce back in 2nd test, Axar gets trainning for that, English player made so many runs with Sweep shot especially Joe root, With Black clay Ball will bounce more than one with Red Clay (1st test)



I think nothing will help india if they not post decent 1st innings score with the bat.


starts tomorrow

Chennai 2nd test feb 13-17,2021



Ind vs Eng



Eng announced team of 12 for 2nd Test

I wonder who  will left out?



Probable XI: Rory Burns, Dom Sibley, Dan Lawrence, Joe Root ©, Ben Stokes, Ollie Pope, Ben Foakes (wk), Moeen Ali, Jack Leach, Chris Woakes/Olly Stone, Stuart Broad





Probable XI: Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli ©, Ajinkya Rahane, Rishabh Pant (wk), Axar Patel/Washington Sundar, R Ashwin, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma





Did you know?








India won toss only 2nd time Virat won toss vs eng but lost 10 against them



No Bumrah

No Sundar

No Nadeem



Debut by Axar, while Siraj & Kuldeep playing 



Eng incudes Fast bowler Stone alone with Broad, Foakes & Moeen Ali


Gill LBW off stone 

His 4th  test wicket in his 2nd test



India zero for 1


Rahane should drop for every test in india koz as a batsman in last 30 innings his average 31( with one century in last 8 series) his record in overseas test outstanding as Captain.



If Virat win 2nd Chennai test he will Equal MSD with 21 test win for india


Two important wickets of Pujara and Kohli in quick succession has put England back in the game. Kohli out for zero lasting only 5 balls. India 106/3 at lunch on day 1 with Sharma scoring 80 of those runs in only 78 balls.


Rahane's overseas record has always been much better than his home record. Playing less matches at home than overseas confirms that as well is his overseas average. On the other hand Kohli's home average is 66 while his overseas average is only 44. Kohli hasn't scored a hundred his last 9 test innings and averages only 22.


STAT - First time Kohli has been dismissed bowled in successive innings at home. (only fourth time overall in 63 inngs in India).


14 test 51 wickets Leach, doing good

But i am Surprise why Bess left out?

He is better batsman too.


Bess was dropped for Moeen Ali which is surprising after taking 5 wickets in the last test.


Rohit hits century as opener, Rahane & Rohit Bombaykar put on 78* now. Ind 164/3



100 off 130 ball

14 fours & 2 sixes


4.5° turn in 2nd test (lot less on day 1& 2 in 1st test), difficult wicket to play shots.



Rohit completed his 7th test  centuty on indian soil



England Spin bowling Coach Jeetan patel

Was seen with D.Bess on how to

Bowls on such wicket




I think dropping Bess for Moeen was a mistake.


Yes at tea 189 for 3 



Mo 15/0/70/1



If you not try players for 6 mos, it's happen in all form of cricket

It's tuff for Kuldeep later on too.


No escape for ECB this time the way ball turn now, I think last 6 Indian player will dismiss cheaply


Fine 50* by Rahane in supporting role with Rohit who hits his 1st test century vs England partnership now 122* 



3 pm in india 29 more overs left on day 1.india should lick run


Rohit's strike rate 178 when he play Sweep shot


Partnership of 162 broken at last with Sharma caught off Leach 161. Rahane goes as well for 66 bowled by Moeen..... India 249/5. Two new batsmen at the crease, both on zero.


Root gets Ashwin, India 284/6. There is a rough area outside the left handers off stump, lot of turn from there and its still day 1. Wont be easy for England when they bat and they have to bat last as well.


Debutant Axar & Pant (33 not out)

Batted well for last 33 ball with new ball



End of day 1 after 87 over

India 300 for 6


Cong Root for 32nd  

Test wicket 7/2/14/1


4 players Failed to open account in indian innings.



India 248 for 3

All out 329



Pant 58 not out

Moeen 4 for 128,Stone 3 wkts,Leach 2 and Root 1 wkts each




Ishant gets Burns 0



Eng also 0 for 1


Axar debutant took wicket of

Joe Root



Ash get rid of Sibley



Eng 3 down



So  far 7 wickets fall for

49 runs on day 2


India get both England openers cheaply. The ball is turning all over place, both Ashwin and Patel troubling the English batsmen.



Root goes as I write, trying one sweep too many. Gone with the shot he has made so many runs on this tour of SL and India. First test wicket for Axar Patel in his second over in test cricket. Root has been the mainstay for England, it will be intersting to see how the other batsmen will cope with the spinners with him gone early. England 26/3


England go to lunch on day 2 with the score on 39/4. Lawrance out on the stroke of lunch for another low score. He has a string of low scores after his 73 in the first test in Galle. I think England are on the verge of a huge collapse.


52 for 5

Axar too trouble All english

Batsman 8/3/13/wkt of Root



Ash now 3 wickets.
