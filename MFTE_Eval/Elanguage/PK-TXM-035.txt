1/24/21, 5:40 PM - $B: Right when you know how to make $, it’s not impossible to do it again
1/24/21, 5:42 PM -$A: I know many people trying to bring him down by many things but he told in his life interview that " I cried when bank sent final me a notice to take back possession of mortgaged house and sent his family back to karachi to his parents for a while"
1/24/21, 5:44 PM -$A: later he decided to go back to his Chinese employer in Malaysia where he stayed in his old office because he's senior Microsoft & cisco system engineer then due to cheap costly live in malaysia he started business again from cheaper land and thrown his shoes coat and luxuries and said i'll give free education and my life journey to pakistanies so they'll not make mistakes like me

1/24/21, 9:57 PM - $B: When you have time, you can watch if you’re interested
1/25/21, 1:59 AM -$A: Sure I'll watch this. I always do analysis on such videos like some underworld families who copied same $Bi idea and now taking control of world banking systems and people believe that banks have Rights to control our brain and fantasy with money
1/25/21, 8:25 AM - $B: Right it’s all an illusion
1/25/21, 8:25 AM -$A: Only north korea was safe from this but nowadays that too
1/25/21, 3:33 PM -$A: Another Strategy:

Not so far but today I was having AMZ FBA discussion with friend $S3P2 about minimum budget to launch a small scale product with minimum 70%+ profit margin monthly, we can start around $5K-$7K and this is only for launch.  For bleeding (giveaways for bringing customers traffic) & PPC ( Pay Per Click) advertisement we must have $3k in reserve in which $2k for Advertising campaign and rest of $1k for the same thing but just for backup.
I'll do PPC/Giveaways and Upwork marketing to test our product and leave reviews. I'll also create 5%-20% up & down coupons.
1/25/21, 3:59 PM - $B: Can’t you experiment with 1k budget and see how it does in the market? Take the revenue and reinvest into marketing?
1/25/21, 4:00 PM - $B: Start really small and work up to it. 7k starting seems so high because you don’t know how it will really do once it launches
1/25/21, 4:03 PM -$A: with 1k budget we can't launch a product by ourselves on our seller account. i'm still trying to look if I can still launch in $3k-$4k
We can do AMZ wholesale easily once I'll finish learning bullet concepts. This require minimum $3K but for middleclass person like me it would be hard since the revenue I'll earn in wholesale I'll have to apply all again in bringing more & more products into Amazon warehouse for customers.
1/25/21, 4:05 PM -$A: that's why I and my friend $S3P2 we decided to work for any client for just short time like part time for 2-3 months as AMZ FBA VA to understand the market then we can hit our product. I is not guaranteed that our product would rises quickly but most chances will come up when I and $S3P2 will learn each and everything for our need to run a professional amazon sellers account
