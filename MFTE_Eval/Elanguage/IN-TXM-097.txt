6/14/20, 1:03 PM - $I1: *Happy Birthday $U*
6/17/20, 3:01 PM - $H: Guys, if you're doing any of the NPTEL courses, you are advised to substitute the 6th,7th or 8th semester elective for the best results. Don't substitute it for 5th sem elective as we don't have much time to complete the NPTEL. DM if you want to anything else about this
6/17/20, 3:17 PM - $H: For those of you who don't know what NPTEL courses are:
As you all know, from next year, we'll be having open elective and professional elective subjects( you can find out details in the CSE syllabus document ). The NPTEL courses are oline courses with exams at the end, which are considered an elective by the department. By attending online sessions and taking the exams, your NPTEL marks will be converted to a grade which will be added to your report card for the semester you have chosen.( Go check your email for more info )
As our 8th semester almost entirely consists of elective courses, we can use these NPTEL courses to substitute for them, so that during 8th sem, we will be free to do internships, etc.
There are 8 NPTEL courses approved by our department. Go to your mail and check the most recent mail for info on what these courses are.
6/17/20, 3:18 PM - $H: 
6/17/20, 3:18 PM - $H: To check how many elective courses we have, check this out.
6/17/20, 3:21 PM - $D: Thanks $H
6/17/20, 3:24 PM - $C: Thanks a lot $H🙌🏽🙌🏽
6/17/20, 3:25 PM - $H: Go fill out the form guys, everyone needs to fill the form it seems( it's in your mail )
6/17/20, 3:25 PM - $H: Also you can only do a total of 2 NPTEL courses( 6 credits )
6/17/20, 3:26 PM - $H: So be careful where you want to substitute it
6/17/20, 3:29 PM - $H: Also, you're welcome ppl :)))
6/17/20, 5:02 PM - $H: 
6/17/20, 5:02 PM - $H: 
6/17/20, 5:04 PM - $H: The form's phrasing isn't clear, so I'll explain this part.
What they mean by 5th semester is the time between July and October this year, not the college's 5th SEM.
If you wanna do an NPTEL course during July - October 2020 instead of an 8th sem elective, you have to click the "Willing to take one course in 5th semester" option and choose the 8th sem elective you want to substitute in the next page.
6/17/20, 5:05 PM - $H: If you want to do two, you can choose the "Willing to take 2 courses" option here
6/17/20, 8:37 PM - $H: *Some clarity regarding NPTEL:*
1. The form that was sent to you is for the term July- October. It was sent to us so that we can utilize this time of pandemic to complete online courses.
2. If you don't want to do an NPTEL course during July- October, but want to do it next year, don't worry, you can. You will get a form to apply for NPTEL courses next year as well, for the next term( probably something like Jan- April). Fill the form, and click on the no option when it asks whether you are willing to attend NPTEL courses during 5th semester ( July- October term).
3. If you want to do an NPTEL course now, you have to select an elective in a semester you want to substitute. But if you don't like your results or would like to change the elective you want to substitute, you have to decide in beginning of the that semester.
Eg.: If you have registered for the NPTEL course now by substituting a course in 8th semester, at the beginning of 8th semester you will be asked if you want to substitute your open elective(OE) or professional elective (PE) with an NPTEL course. If you say yes, you can't attempt the normal OE/PE courses, and your final grade will be your NPTEL grade.
If you say no, then you will be allowed to attempt the OE/PE courses.
Until the 8th semester, you will be allowed to attempt as many NPTEL courses as you want, you can choose the ones with the best grade to substitute with your OE/PE.
In the above situation, if you decide that you don't want to attempt an OE/PE of 6th semester, even though you've registered for substitution of an elective in the 8th semester, you will be allowed to substitute your OE/PE in the 6th semester *if you tell them in the beginning of the 6th semester*.
4. If you decide to register for an NPTEL course next term, you might get an updated list of courses, possibly different from the list of courses available now.
So essentially you can attempt an NPTEL course during any term and use it for any OE/PE in any of the upcoming semesters, *if you tell them at the beginning of the semester*
The mapping from NPTEL marks to our grade will be the same way our college normally maps grades( O--100-91,A+--90-81...)
All of us have to fill the form whether we want to do a course or not.
6/17/20, 8:37 PM - $H: I hope all of you are clear after this
6/17/20, 8:37 PM - $H: If you haven't read the earlier stuff, just read this
6/17/20, 8:37 PM - $H: If you're still not clear, you can always DM :)
6/19/20, 5:27 PM - $O: 
6/19/20, 5:28 PM - $K1: 😲
6/19/20, 5:29 PM - $H: I'm gonna type smthn after this
6/19/20, 5:29 PM - $H: Don't spam
6/19/20, 5:29 PM - $H: And pls wait
6/19/20, 5:31 PM - $O: 
6/19/20, 5:31 PM - $O: 
6/19/20, 5:31 PM - $H: So they've told other depts that we're gonna have model semester exams in July. So we decided that we need some solid argument to help convince them against exams. So we decided to introduce a poll from every student in the 2nd year from all depts so that we can show them that we are in no state to write online exams.

6/19/20, 5:31 PM - $H: It is pretty much official
6/19/20, 5:32 PM - $H: 
6/19/20, 5:32 PM - $T: Would the fact that almost every other college has cancelled help?
6/19/20, 5:32 PM - $O: I see
6/19/20, 5:32 PM - $H: This is what SASTRA did
6/19/20, 5:32 PM - $L: When have they ever taken our concerns into account
6/19/20, 5:32 PM - $H: Ofc, but if all of us fill this form, it will provide statistics
6/19/20, 5:32 PM - $H: When all of us say shit they have to consider
6/19/20, 5:32 PM - $H: Remember it's not just our dept this time
6/19/20, 5:33 PM - $H: 
6/19/20, 5:33 PM - $H: Fill this pls
6/19/20, 5:33 PM - $H: All of you
6/19/20, 5:35 PM - $H: And please type stuff in the opinion category
6/19/20, 5:36 PM - $H: If you don't know what to type, look at this for some reference
6/19/20, 5:40 PM - $E: How many people have responded so far ?
6/19/20, 5:42 PM - $H: Many
6/19/20, 5:42 PM - $H: From all departments
6/19/20, 5:42 PM - $R: Do your part man
6/19/20, 5:42 PM - $R: I did mine
6/19/20, 5:42 PM - $K1: 🔥
6/19/20, 5:43 PM - $O: 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
6/19/20, 5:44 PM - $H: I'd really like all of you guys to fill the form without hesitation and type out your problems in detail. Our sentiments do matter to an extent. If you don't have internet, or find it stressful to attempt exams, please type it in the opinion space. Don't be lazy and think that one opinion won't be seen, please type out stuff
6/19/20, 5:45 PM - $S: 👍🏽
6/19/20, 5:48 PM - $G: If everyone one of us conveys our opinions then even SSN will have to reconsider its decision. The main point in our favor is that this time we aren't appealing to the department(which is well known for ignoring student issues), but to the entire college. So there is a decent chance that our efforts might pay off.
6/19/20, 5:52 PM - $G: Please fill the form, and put some valid points in the opinion space
6/19/20, 5:55 PM - $K1: Done
6/19/20, 5:56 PM - $D: +1
6/19/20, 5:56 PM - $K1: +2

6/19/20, 6:04 PM - $U: does anyone want the exams?
6/19/20, 6:05 PM - $H: Nope not online
6/19/20, 6:05 PM - $H: Online is impossible for me
6/19/20, 6:05 PM - $U: ok good
6/19/20, 6:06 PM - $A1: Not at all.
6/19/20, 6:07 PM - $R: Honestly speaking, we do need a lab rat to say "YES" so that it looks more authentic
