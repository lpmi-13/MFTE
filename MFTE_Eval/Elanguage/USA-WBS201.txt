Share and access content stored in Box directly from within Microsoft Teams – without flipping back and forth between programs. This saves you time, streamlines administration, and facilitates team collaboration. Perhaps more importantly, it also enables Box to be your common content layer in Teams, as it gives you the option to use Box as a content layer across all Teams, Channels, and Chats.
Finally, content doesn’t have to originate in Box to be shared via this integration. For example, files on your local machine are automatically uploaded into a secure Box folder when you share them via Teams. They are not sent to native content stores such as OneDrive and SharePoint.

Adding the integration to your account
When you first log onto your Teams account after your Box admin enables the integration, one of the following happens:
- If a Team member has already installed the Box for Teams integration, you receive the following:a welcome message explaining basic functionalitya Box icon in your message extension tray for upload / sharing of filesa Box Files tab for access to all content associated with the specific Team Channel to which you belong.
- If a Team member has not already installed the integration directly to your Teams and Channel:
- in the bottom tray icon you must click the ellipsis (…) to view the application icons, and then click Box.
- When you click Box, Box prompts you to sign in.
Also, when you use the integration for the first time – either via the Box Files tab or by using Teams to share or upload content – the system prompts you to sign into Box and grant Microsoft access to your account.
After you sign in and grant access:
- you can access content that has already been shared in this channel
- Box automatically creates two new folders you can view in the Box Web app:Microsoft Teams Chat FilesMicrosoft Teams Folder
These Teams folders persist in your Box Web app, regardless of whether you’re signed in.
To sign out of the Box integration, right-click the Box icon and click Settings. Then sign out.

Error: There was an error communicating with the server. Please check your URL and your credentials and try again
Error Message
Attempting to federate ArcGIS for Server with Portal for ArcGIS results in the following error:
"There was an error communicating with the server. Please check your URL and your credentials and try again."
Cause
This is a known issue when Portal for ArcGIS is accessed via a Domain Naming System (DNS) alias. A mismatch in the Service URL and Administration URL in the certification causes the federation to fail.
Solution or Workaround
Note: This issue can be resolved by re-registering the Portal Web Adaptor with the DNS alias. If registering the Web Adaptor with the DNS alias fails to resolve the problem, proceed with the steps listed below.
- Connect to the Internet Information Services (IIS) Web Server.
- Generate a self-signed certificate for the IIS Web Server fully qualified domain name by following the instructions in the ArcGIS Resources: Enabling SSL using a self-signed certificate document.
- Bind the self-signed certificate to port 443.
- Launch a web browser from the IIS Web Server, and navigate to the Portal via the IIS Web Server fully qualified domain name (FQDN) URL and Web Adaptor URL.
- Run the federation process between ArcGIS for Server and Portal for ArcGIS.
- Validate the federation through the Portal page via the FQDN or Web Adaptor of the IIS Web Server.
- Reset the certificate binding in the IIS Manager to the newly created self-signed certificate.
- Verify the federation by connecting to the ArcGIS Server Manager and Admin endpoints to ensure a portal token was requested.

If you're planning on streaming multiple online classes at the same time, you'll need to create a user for each instructor in Zoom and then link each user to a separate online venue in TeamUp. This is because it's not possible for one user to host multiple meetings at the same time.
If you're planning on streaming multiple online classes at the same time, you'll need to create a user for each instructor in Zoom and then link each user to a separate online venue in TeamUp. This is because it's not possible for one user to host multiple meetings at the same time.
Please check Zoom pricing to ensure you're on a plan that supports multiple users.
For example, at 9:00am on Monday, one of your instructors, Peter, will be streaming a Mat class, and another, Susan, will be teaching a Mobility class.
As we mentioned earlier, it's not possible for the same Zoom user to host multiple meetings at the same venue. In order to set these classes up, you'll need to:
Create multiple users on your Zoom account. Each instructor will need to have their own Zoom user. Once you've created the users on Zoom, you'll be able to assign each user to their online venue on TeamUp. For help creating users on your Zoom account, please see this guide.
Create multiple online venues on TeamUp and assign each one the correct Zoom user, as seen in 'Creating an online venue where Zoom meetings are created automatically' earlier in this guide.
For the example above, once done, you should have:
TeamUp online venue #1 (Mat class venue) assigned to Zoom user #1 (Peter).
TeamUp online venue #2 (Mobility class) assigned to Zoom user #2 (Susan).
For help creating an online venue, see An overview of the Zoom integration with TeamUp.
If you've created multiple Zoom users but they aren't showing up in the venue settings on TeamUp, click 'Refresh your Zoom account users' (Settings >> Venues).
