@johncrossmirror Hate it when journalists throw the word ‚Äúclass‚Äù around regarding footballers far too easily

Zinkernagel fucking asleep, Grabban missed a sitter to put the game to bed, Bong still stealing a living‚Ä¶ last 5 min summary  #NFFC


January is going to be massive. Expect the two wingbacks to be recalled and we need some more fire power without question. Costly miss that sitter from Grabban #NFFC


Are we going to turn up.. haven‚Äôt so far. Liverpool are there for the taking @Arsenal #Afc


Players bottled it from the get go #arsenal #AFC


@Arsenal players should be ashamed of themselves, 1 player turned up today, we were beaten before we set foot on the pitch‚Ä¶. Shocking #afc


@KingLafs Special needs post from someone who doesn‚Äôt understand


@TheAthleticUK Absolute smash and grab. Spuds got v v lucky


Didn‚Äôt realise we‚Äôve only had 1 win in the last 5 games. It‚Äôs felt a lot more positive than that. No less than 3 points will do tomorrow #NFFC


Such a weak line up of C list ‚Äúcelebrities‚Äù don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll bother this series thanks #imacelebrity


@NFFC What the fuck is that. Absolutely ridiculous to be starting Taylor. It‚Äôs like playing with 10 men from the start. Absolute sodding joke #NFFC


Any Forest fan who wants to see Lyle Taylor play in the team is a fucking retard #NFFC


Swap Taylor for Grabban so we can stop playing with 10 men #NFFC


I blame Cooper for only picking up one point. Starting Taylor is unforgivable management. 1 win in 6 is a far cry from the positivity of when he started #NFFC


@bbc so Michael Vaughan is guilty until proven innocent regarding the claims he denies. Outrageous decision. #theashes #engaus #cricket


@SkyBetChamp @WhoScored Blackburn fan picked team of the week then


@sajidjavid why are you only taking action on people arriving from Sourh Africa on Sunday. If the variant is that much of a concern why is this action not being taken IMMEDIATELY? #covid19


Fucking game over Bong‚Äôs playing üôÑ #NFFC


Johnson has so much still to learn at this level it‚Äôs staggering he‚Äôs not signed a new contract yet. I really hope he doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs better than he is #NFFC


@CheshireBlueCW2 @ManCity Wasn‚Äôt so long ago you were crying in league one until the oil money came along. You‚Äôre not a proper blue if youve forgotten where you came from. The championship its proper football‚Ä¶ not financially doped shit


Not looked like scoring #NFFC


If we don‚Äôt bring Grabban on for Taylor at half time then Cooper has thrown this game #NFFC


@reddynotts You could argue what‚Äôs the point of having him. He‚Äôll probably come on and score a hat-trick against us now The chances are he‚Äôs not been training with the intensity required for the championship he‚Äôs probably not fit enough either. If it‚Äôs a deal until mid Jan I don‚Äôt get it


That‚Äôs no problem. He‚Äôll probably get injured tying his shoe laces before kick off #NFFC #royals https://t.co/RZQkA30cxc


@PurelyFootball That‚Äôs called a skeleton


@sporteventsrmh He‚Äôs not been the same player since he came back this season. That Taylor miss üò´


Whilst we‚Äôve been better than #sufc and completely mugged off for a stone wall penalty if you play Taylor then you know you won‚Äôt score until you bring Grabban on. Have got to stop using Taylor for anything other than an impact sub #NFFC


GRABBAN SHOULD START EVERY GAME FFS #NFFC


We should sent Garner back to #ManUtd in January‚Ä¶. He‚Äôs regressed so much from last season #NFFC


#sufc absolutely got away with one there. Completely mauled by #NFFC especially in the 2nd half and very lucky the refere was a blade.


Garner MOTM? He was awful! #NFFC


@reddynotts As bemusing as the refereeing decisions (again)


@BBCRNS Last night Lyle Taylor went back to being‚Ä¶.. Lyle Taylor #NFFC


@MarkyMBryans Southgate is clueless #southgateout


@MarkyMBryans So if he‚Äôs looking for consistency and form how does Maguire get into the squad?


@parky_pne Defender kicked through the back of the standing leg of Johnson. It‚Äôs as stone wall as they get


Not sure what game Emma Saunders is watching at #NFFC if she thinks it‚Äôs all Preston this half @SkySportsNews


If Brewster was ¬£23m then Brennan is genuinely worth ¬£30m #NFFC


#klopp is losing the plot. Constantly blaming officials when when no one else thought it was a foul on Allison (who was at fault for 2/3 if not 3/3 of the goals yesterday). Feels like a slippery slope to me and the beginning of the end #LFC #liverpoolfc


Why would #Potter go to #avfc from #bhafc no difference at all in standing of either club. #brightonfc arguably in better shape on and off the pitch. From a neutral


Think we need to face reality and that Spence will be going back to Boro in Jan. Crazy to include a recall clause and no option to buy. We‚Äôve done all the hard work getting the best out of him and Wilder is still likely to be smarting from us choosing Cooper over him. #NFFC

@toniboro @DjedSpence @NFFC Be interesting what the player wants to do. Wilder‚Äôs old school. Boro didn‚Äôt want Djed and he‚Äôs playing the best football of his career at Forest‚Ä¶ if I were him I wouldn‚Äôt want to go back! Boro we‚Äôre open to selling in the summer but a price couldn‚Äôt be agreed in time apparently

@fa do you not even be thinking about giving Tottenham preferential treatment with postponing their games due to Covid. You threw @Arsenal under the bus at the start of the season and made us effectively forfeit our first 3  games. A precedent was set! #AFC


Tottenham have probably got the infected players breathing on the others to get the games called off https://t.co/3PatZEdkWv


A precedent was set! The FA essentially made Arsenal forfeit their first 3 games of the season by not being sympathetic to Covid cases in the playing squad https://t.co/3GeWllOaY4


So Arsenal get to replay the games against Brentford, City and Chelsea do they? https://t.co/Cm8nyV0aj2

How can #omicron cause 25k - 75k more deaths, realty is NOONE has yet died from it anywhere in the world and hardly anyone is in hospital from it? These scientists and modellers have had their 5 minutes of fame and are loathed to give it up! @SkyNews @BBCNews #covid19 #covid


@nottmtails Hi Paul. Did #NFFC include a sell on clause when they sold Brereton to Blackburn? If so do you know roughly what %?

@fa #manutd have well and truly pulled your pants down with the postponement yesterday. Back in training today. What a joke and you fell for it all because they had a couple of injuries!


@pbsportswriter If you look at the replays on BT sport it is a clear penalty. He went over the top of the ball and took out Laca. Admittedly you had to see it 3-4 times from different angles but it was the right decision


@pbsportswriter Maybe they should stop the players diving into the crowd to celebrate after scoring as many are still doing. If players are sticking to their bubbles there should be no reason why so many are testing positive


@pbsportswriter Think you mean Ramsdale is Englands No.1 and by some margin


@FabrizioRomano How? The transfer window hasn‚Äôt opened yet


Tomi is in the top 3 RB‚Äôs in the PL! Probably only 2nd to TAA https://t.co/4UddWzKt3P


Only ¬£20m under his true value! https://t.co/P42tepU9oO


@Clarkey_No1 His true value as 20 million in the current climate its 30 million. You just have to look at Brewster signing for Sheffield United for 23 million and Johnson is better than him


@NFFC are you going to reach out to @CovUnitedLFC to help them train and keep match fit as Stoke Ladies have done? Nottingham being just up the M1. @NFFCWomen


Comfortably the worst half we have played under Cooper. Only positive is that it‚Äôs 0-1 and we surely can‚Äôt be as bad 2nd half #NFFC #boro


@TimTheSurgeon Simple. Do not treat unvaccinated people. Why should vaccinated people with health conditions suffer?  Vaccinated patients requiring treatments should be the priority over the unvaccinated #COVID19

@HMRC should NOT cut a deal on #DCFC debt obligations. Better run business have not been cut a deal and it will forever mean that any business who spends beyond its means will be able to write off #HMRC debt. This cannot be allowed to happen just because its a football club #NFFC


Poor and partey has been awful. We have no central midfield https://t.co/49STFe4fN6


This one is on the manager. We‚Äôve been walked through the whole game in midfield and he‚Äôs not seen fit to change it Saka, Lukonga Should have been on at half-time https://t.co/yFAeDy6DcM


@gunnerblog Artet has to take the lion share of the blame. Why would you pick a midfield like that when United midfield is awful and there for the taking. It‚Äôs starting to piss me off how he sets his team up so defensively against so called big teams. He needs to focus on how we play!


@charles_watts Arteta‚Äôs fault. You can‚Äôt legislate for Partey not turning up why earth did he pick Elnenny when the United midfield is as weak as it is.


@ExLeftForFriend @gunnerblog Lukonga should have started. Laca come on earlier, Saka come on earlier. Are you telling me we don‚Äôt have other midfielders who can‚Äôt go to Toe2Toe better with that United midfield than that dick Elnenny


@ExLeftForFriend @gunnerblog AMN would have been better than Elnenny


@ExLeftForFriend @ScottWilkins9 @gunnerblog As I said in my first message I‚Äôm more annoyed with the manager for the midfield combination today. He can‚Äôt legislate for Partey not turning up today. He picks a more attacking midfield against so-called lesser clubs and worries about the bigger clubs too much


@ExLeftForFriend @ScottWilkins9 @gunnerblog I agree the striking solution is worrying. Auba is in no form and everybody else is going. It‚Äôs going to require major surgery in Jan but will the club stump up he cash to sign the players needed to make a difference. As a minimum we need a top striker and a top midfielder


@ExLeftForFriend @ScottWilkins9 @gunnerblog I can‚Äôt disagree with pretty much any of that. I still think Partey on his day is class but he struggled this last couple of weeks


Shorting short of a win today will be acceptable #NFFC


Someone explain the Brennan Johnson hype to me‚Ä¶. Completely lacking any end product #NFFC


Oh dear Grabbs‚Ä¶. How can you miskick it from 1 yard out?  #NFFC


Why aren‚Äôt unvaccinated people facing a forced lockdown over the festive period so those of us who have done the right thing can carry on as normal reducing the risk of additional measures in the new year. It‚Äôs the unvaccinated who spread it! @SkyNews @BBCNews #covid #covid19

You can‚Äôt use Taylor as a starter. Has to try and be an impact sub. Scored 2 good goals against Bristol City but that‚Äôs about it #NFFC
