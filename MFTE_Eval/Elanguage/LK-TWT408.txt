Don’t break the chain - thanks for the tag @Sxxxxxxxo 

- wallpaper
- last song you listened to

@Pxxxxxxxxxx_ @Oxxxxxxxxxxxxxa Marble cake!!!


@nxxxxxxxxxk #India should do a research on air pollution in #America.


@Sxxxxxxxo @BxxxxxS Send it if you don’t want. 😁


@rxxxxxxxxxd She will need to ask the monks for permission! Also what lockdown?


@Txxxxxxxxxxxxk @GxxxxxxxR @Pxxxxxxxxxxxa I don’t think they know what rock bottom means! 😂😂


@sxxxxxxxxxxxa Sis and I gobble it. With bread. With whatever combo. 😁. Like a dipping sauce.


@sxxxxxxxxxxxa Less than a week. https://t.co/2cRRaaWiRl


@DxxxxxxxxxxxxL @UxxxxxxM better do a pcr test.


Apparently #SriLanka cannot afford a lockdown. Does that mean the country can afford people dying in the country? People die daily but I doubt a country loses this many people a day. Unless the country is at war. #lka #COVID19LK #GetVaccinatedSaveLives


@Sxxxxxxxo Yeah right! 🙄


@Pxxxxxxxxxx_ So many of us would! 😂😂


@Rxxxxxxxxh Until last month. 

https://t.co/UUbmCb2ugq https://t.co/PG6yMHnMA2


@rxxxxxxxxxd Wondering whether he has to pay interest for that loan he has taken! 🤔


@Sxxxxxxxo You are one!


@Jxxxxxx1 @GxxxxxxxR @Pxxxxxxxxxxxa @Sxxxxxxxxxxxxx2 @KxxxxxxxxR Will say an investigation will be conducted. Until then kept in quarantine. Bring something else to distract the people and forget about the whole incident. 💁‍♂️


@Pxxxxxxxxxx_ Might sit on it too!


@Lxxxxxxxxxxxxo Money is more important than the lives of people! 💁‍♂️


@mxxxxx4 @cxxxxxx9 I don’t care if I am a good Buddhist or not. What matters to me is we all get out of this pandemic alive by adhering to proper guidelines set by doctors who knows and are doing the best they can for not only Lankans but to the whole world. I’m not saying chanting  is bad...


@nxxxxxxxxxxa Few watches from a long range of brands? Like a couple from each brand?


@Sxxxxxxxxxe There could be a shortage of Pfizer in the coming weeks due to booster shots given in some countries. It could happen. US, Israel are giving the people another dose despite @WxO saying not to do so as yet.


@Mxxxxxxxn My deepest sympathies to you and your family. 😔


@nxxxxxxxxxxa How many watches do you have?


@nxxxxxxxxxxa The watch is nice. However definitely sure the price is not nice at all. 😂😂


@Txxxxxxxxxxxxk @GxxxxxxxR How did the phone get in?


@Txxxxxxxxxxxxk The moment the cricket team wins a series, they will be expecting that much as a reward from now onwards! 😄😄


@mxxxxxxxxx Sad news... *sigh*


@mxxxxxxxxx Same.


@Sxxxxxxxxxxxxx1 @Pxxxxxxg I don’t know about versions. All I know is “baby shark, do do do do....”


@sxxxxxxxxx_ @gxxxxxxxs How do you get over a slump? Difficult to keep reading these days. Dunno why.


@Sxxxxxxxxxxxxx1 @mxxxxxxxxx @Rxxxxxxxxh @axxxxxt @mxxxa @Jxxxxxxxxxxl @nxxxxxxxxxs @Nxxxxxxxxy @mxxxxxxxxx download those songs for the café! Will drop by to listen to them over a coffee! What do you say? 🤣🤣


@Ixxxxxxxxxxx6 Well aware of it. What to do. We die because of stupidity and not because of the virus. *sigh*


@Sxxxxxxxxxxxxx1 @mxxxxxxxxx @Rxxxxxxxxh @axxxxxt @mxxxa @Jxxxxxxxxxxl @nxxxxxxxxxs @Nxxxxxxxxy Does it include baby shark do do? I think that’s the name? 😄😄


@mxxxxx4 @cxxxxxx9 It’s just that we need to invest more in science rather in religion. Pray for all I care but don’t invest a lot in religion right now. Once this is all over, pray all you want 24/7. Give thanks, alms etc. I am and will give what I can to the poor. First invest in healthcare.


@cxxxxxx9 Coming from a Buddhist family, chanting  is useless! Like that has helped! If that helped, everyone would be living a happy life in a happy country! Like  saved the people who died from the virus.  was chanted before. Did it save the people from dying?


@nxxxxxN Will our savings be worth anything??? 😭😭😭


@mxxxxx4 This is a joke of a lockdown anyways... I can see people visiting houses from other areas and enjoying time with friends and family. Not arrested or even sent away.


@gxxxxxxxn Passport services, ID renewal, vehicle fees, post etc are quite good. Easy to use.


@Ixxxxxxxxxxxt I had the same with vacations. 😆


@Gxxxxxxxxxxs Did we survive 20 & 21??? https://t.co/pxxckLa8qO


@sxxxxxxs I’m so sorry for your loss. Think about him and never ever forget about him. Although it may hurt you by thinking, at least you keep him alive by the memories you had with him. 😔💔


@Jxxxxxx1 @Pxxxxxxxxxxxa Rest of the ministers cannot sacrifice their pay?


@Axxxxxxxxxb Another experiment by Basil? Last time he wanted to see if he could import the virus. This time trying to export the new variants of the virus to the world?


@Axxxxxx4 @Cxxxxxxxxxxxxl That bad?


@kxxxxxxxs @Oxxxxxxxxxxxxxa I think you are the female version of Jughead!!! 😂😂😂 It’s so tempting!!! https://t.co/BC8woriKk6


@Oxxxxxxxxxxxxxa Sure. Sure. By now you must have blessed the entire planet. You alone! 😆😆


@Bxxxxxxxxxxxe #Srilankans love to show their wealth!


@Cxxxxxxxxxu When kids in the villages have to climb trees to get any coverage to access the internet, cryptocurrency is the priority. 🤦‍♂️


@Rxxxxxxxxh Maybe he wants to be the Maharaja of Indian tourists!? 😄😄


@Axxxxxxxxxb The army, health workers get a fixed income right? Will they take from them as well? I would like to see the blast if they do so! 🤣🤣🤣


@mxxxxxxxxx ‘Shitsta’ would have been more appropriate.


@Axxxxxxxxxb I wonder who is paying back for the loans the government takes. Still want to take it from the people. 💁‍♂️


Happy Birthday @txxxxxxxx. Have a lovely time. Cheers. 🎂 🎉 🎊


Yo @sxxxxxxxxxx! Happy Birthday! Have a blast! Cheers! 🍻


@Rxxxxxxxxh The money taken includes for the livelihood betterment. So can’t the government give that money to the public? 

https://t.co/3zsN43wp8a


Happy Birthday @dxxxxx. Have a blast. Cheers. 🍻


@mxxxxxxxxx What’s that?


@axxxxj @dxxxxxxxxxxa Person with so much of items was like how can he be given priority when he is a loyal customer and is that the way you treat your customers and so on. Was shouting at the cashier when the manager came. Made an uncomfortable scene. Got some nice manners! 😄


@axxxxj @dxxxxxxxxxxa Some are genuinely nice. There was one instance where the cashier asked the customer who was in the line with a load of groceries if he would like to give the other person who had two items the chance to bill the goods and leave.


@Sxxxxxxxxxxxxxu @vxxxxx_ Follow @Mxxxxxxxxxxxxx4 @mxxxxx4 @Exxxxxx1 @Axxxxxxxi ...


@dxxxxxxxxxxa As long as they don’t have bills to pay as well.


@Axxxxxxxi Definitely Bandula is behind this. Who else could survive with Rs 2000???


@Oxxxxxxxxxxxxxa @nxxxxxZ Yup. Looks like they are releasing it as a birthday present. 😄


@nxxxxxZ Hopefully it will be good! Nov 7!!!


@mxxxxxxxxx End of an era!  😔


@nxxxxxZ Haven’t heard this in ages!


@Axxxxxxxxxb Didn’t Cabraal say the govt won’t go to the IMF?


@Sxxxxxxxo That’s understandable on your part. Can’t run at a loss right.


@Sxxxxxxxo Increasing your prices while thinking how consumers will buy. Will they buy the same amount and re-purchase around the same time or buy and ration it for a longer period? Talking about the non-perishables. *sigh*


#Srilanka, install them at all the car parks in the country! #lka #SolarPower #renewableenergy #carparks #supermarkets https://t.co/rvXxRECD5M


@sxxxp Omg. Memorable ad. *sigh*





@Sxxxxxxxxm All the best! Share your tips and progress with us. 😊


@Axxxxxxxxxb Have to ask him if there’s any inflation in the country due to money printing. 😄


@Oxxxxxxxxxxxxxa What do you think you are doing to us???


@mxxxxx4 Doesn’t it occur to them that foreign companies/countries could retaliate by doing the same to our goods? Perhaps higher taxes, quotas etc? 🤔


@Rxxxxxxxxh Does this mean that they agree that the country is turning out to be a dictatorship? 🤔


@mxxxxxxxxx #Delta is old news now.


@dxxxxxxxxa Plus our PM using @exxxxxxs over @fxxxxxxxxxxn to go to Italy! 🤦‍♂️


@fxxxxxxxxxxn Don’t you have direct flights to Italy?


@axxxxxt @fxxxxxxxxxxn doesn’t have direct flights to Italy?


@mxxxxxxxxx Create a new menu called Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour!! 😂😂


@nxxxxxxxxxxa Quite lovely! 😍


@Rxxxxxxxxh *sigh* If the previous govt got away with the crap they did, why can’t this govt huh...


@zxxxxxc @Rxxxxxxxxh @Sxxxxxxxxxxxxx1 President did ask us to make some sacrifices in the future right!


@Sxxxxxxxxxxxxx1 The president & the First Lady,if she is going, gets to see their grandson when they go to America! So why can’t the PM take the wife for some shopping and pasta? 😁


@Axxxxxxxxxb Can’t he print dollars???


@Axxxxxxxxxb The end of @Ixxxxxs if that happens! 😂😂


Vendors will begin to hoard and sell at higher prices! 🤦‍♂️ #Srilanka #lka #economy https://t.co/ZUQt10GSi6


@mxxxxx4 @Exxxxxxxxxxxxxa Looks like #Srilanka doesn’t care. Most of us would just spend on the basic necessities. Will save the money. Again bad for the economy. Although banks would like it.


@Rxxxxxxxxh We should be more concerned if You Know Who becomes governor. Imagine if the Cabinet gives the approval for him to do anything he wants with #CBSL!!!


@GxxxxxxxW Use it to listen to music? Donate it. Keeping notes.


@Jxxxxxx1 Congrats! Hope all the things that you had to endure will be rewarded one day. Sprinkle chilli water to all the people who threaten you! 😁 Cheers! 🥂


@Jxxxxxx1 Break the trend! Why must the politicians have all the fun? 😂😂


@sxxxxxxxxxs Hell yes! Can’t wait for fb to have dark mode for the mobile app!


@Axxxxxxxxxb Well aware! I’m not part of the 6.9M! 😂😂. Sadly by 2025, many will forget and vote again for murderers, theives and the corrupt! 😔😔


@Axxxxxxxxxb Or get the same thing when things die down!


@Rxxxxxxxxh Won’t happen that from any party.


@mxxxxxxxxx @jxxxxxk When the hullabaloo dies down, he will be reinstated. President or PM will say he is a changed man bla bla bla.


@rxxxxxxxxxd Silent because they are coming up with an excuse and will want something to distract us and forget about the whole thing...


@Gxxxxxxxxxxxxa Why not use @fxxxxxxxxxxx? Why did the PM use @exxxxxxx? Govt tells the people to stop importing but the said Govt is using foreign airlines to travel!!! Shouldn’t you practice what you preach? 

https://t.co/AckmhqX5mH


While the national/flag carrier of #Srilanka is @fxxxxxxxxxxx, #GoSL uses @exxxxxxx! Any thoughts on that? #lka #airlines #forex https://t.co/EJ94chuP84


@mxxxxx4 Have forex to travel in @exxxxxxs and not in @fxxxxxxxxxxx!


@Axxxxxxxxxxa Like watching a scary movie. Damn...


Aloha @sxxxxxxxxxx. Happy Birthday! Hope you are having a lovely time! Cheers. 🥂


@dxxxxxxxxe Two birds with one stone. You get to visit the country and buy a phone and come. We all were stuck for almost two years right! 😂😂


@mxxxxx4 This is how people are supposed to make sacrifices! 😂😂


@mxxxxxxxxx If you need help with the tasting, lemme know! 😁😋


@mxxxxxxxxx @Sxxxxxxxo @axxxxxxw Shall we break into her house @mxxxxxxxxx? 😁😁


@Sxxxxxxxxxxxt Most probably due to the low pcr tests conducted. Low number of tests=low cases reported.


@Wxxxxxxxxxa Expect accidents in the future when local companies increase the prices of tyres.


@cxxxxxxxxxxxxxy This #Jokedown will definitely be lifted! What’s the point?


@txxxxxxi Calling Prados an essential good! 😂😂


#Maldives don’t have sand? 🤔 #Srilanka #lka https://t.co/wk8O3YV2LP


@JxxxxxxxxxxxxS I’m so sorry for your loss. My deepest sympathies. 😔


@Rxxxxxxxxh Didn’t we have that under the previous government? 😂😂


@axxxxj @Jxxxxxx1 @DxxxxxxxxxxxxL Will banks be safe? If they won’t be safe, will our peanut savings be safe? Is it time to withdraw the money and hide them under our beds??? 😂😂


@Rxxxxxxxxh #GreekBonds before. Now what will it be?? #EthiopianBonds #NigerianBonds


@sxxxxxxxxxxx @rxxxxxxxxxxxe I thought it was @sxxxxxxxxxx. 😁😄


@VxxxxxO Vaccine appointment is pointless. I did an appointment online. When I went there, no queue for appointments or walk-ins. You have to wait in the same line to fill the form and to take the jab.


@sxxxxxxxxxxx @rxxxxxxxxxxxe Sounds like he is the soul of the party person. 😄😄


@Axxxxxxxxxxxe @bxxxxxxxxl Clubhouse Vivaldi is another option too.


@sxxxxxxxxxs @dxxxxxxk Fair point. However most sites show recommendations according to your search history. 😄😄


@sxxxxxxxxxs @dxxxxxxk What were you searching before media players? 😂😂😂


@Sxxxxxxxo @Wxxxxxxxy @fxxxxxxxxxe Is there a job opening at your place? Wouldn’t mind working for food and drink. 😁😇


What’s the purpose of this “lockdown?” #Srilanka #lka


@Sxxxxxxxxxxxt Sadly it is true according to this. 

https://t.co/1STn7YU0wF https://t.co/v3bhrcZeTo


@nxxxxxxxxxxa @axxxxxxxxl Since he was mentioning several times the $ should be around 185, it could be brought down to that figure right?


@Sxxxxxxxxxe Gingie? Calvin?


@nxxxxxN Once the “lockdown” is lifted, more chances to spread it around. Not that it doesn’t have a chance now. Almost normal traffic and cops aren’t even checking.


@Rxxxxxxxxh Wasn’t one #BondScamSL enough for our lifetime? Let the future generations have once we are dead. Not until then... 😆😆


@Oxxxxxxxxxxxxxa Hell to the yes!!! One of the best intros ever!!! Humming that intro...  a bloody old time classic!!! *sigh


@gxxxxxxxn Prados have become essentials!


@mxxxxx4 Fancy!


@Zxxxxxxxxxxe @PxxxxxxK Then it could be that place.


@Zxxxxxxxxxxe @PxxxxxxK It could be. Compare it with google maps? Sometimes when the place is in nugegoda, pickme maps show it in a different region.


@Zxxxxxxxxxxe Doesn’t show on @Pxxxxxxx?


@gxxxxxxxn Better them!!!


@Txxxxxxxxxxxxk What lockdown men? It’s a #Jokedown! People are out on the streets without a care. Police aren’t even bothered to check.


@Mxxxxxxxn Congrats! 🥂


HE IS ALIVE!!!! #BobMarley #Srilanka #lka https://t.co/iE2N2IKQM5


@mxxxxxxxxx Should release those people into the wild, hunt them down and shoot them!


Like his master, he too wants more power! #Srilanka #lka #CBSLGovernor https://t.co/eqnAuk7NWP


@BxxxxxS @Sxxxxxxxo ! Waiting for elections to dine and wine??? 😂😂😂


@bxxxxxxx_ @nxxxxxxxxxxa @axxxxxxxxl Was it 100 at the time? Damn. Yes why not!! #Srilanka would definitely love it!


@Sxxxxxxxo @BxxxxxS When can we join you and brat for breakfast, lunch, evening coffee and dinner? Perhaps mid-day coffee too. 😁😋🤤😇


@rxxxxxa Everyday they reduce about 200-500 to show that it’s reducing. However pcr tests & the test positivity results show something else. 😄😄


@Sxxxxxxxxxe Ollie a person or a cat?


@SxxxxxxxxB Again? Don’t they release you once you are completely okay? Your parents are at risk then right? 🤔


@mxxxxx4 In the meantime, we have to work to feed them! 😂😂


@mxxxxx4 @txxxxxxxk @mxxxxxxxxa you are risking the lives of #Russians and #Srilankans by agreeing to this! Visit #Srilanka when there are only a few cases and when #Russia have vaccinated more than 50-70%! Right now, Srilanka has reduced pcr tests! @WxO @Wxxxxxxxxxa


@Axxxxxxxxxb @axxxxxt Everyone must be in a zoom meeting right now trying to get the story straight! Pretty sure they will say a story where they were outside the bubble. They did their part days ago and left the event. Everyone inside the bubble have tested negative.
