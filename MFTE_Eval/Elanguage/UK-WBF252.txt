	Tea all the way for me. Coffee stinks. It's just like drinking a cigarette for me. Or black tar. Whichever makes you feel better.



	 



	Not too fussy about teabags either, apart from flavoured tea and Earl Grey which is basically drinking perfume. Yuk.


I drink more water than coffee, i think or try to but between tea or coffee no surprise it's coffee. There are no tea bags in the house.


Hahaha... I feel like we need to introduce you to better coffee..



	 



	and to better Earl Grey.



	 



	So, for me:



		water
	
	
		coffee
	
	
		tea (close second.. just easier for us to get great coffee than it is to get great tea)... and we do loose leaf tea with our own strainers... get that paper taste out of my tea!


I mean tea and coffee are 99% water anyway sooooo......



	 



	I do drink more water than anything, in an attempt to drink less coffee I started having a glass of water between cups.  It just turned out my glass is a 1l beer stein so definitely larger than my coffee mug.



	 



	Though tea and coffee, I don’t really have a preference and go for convenience.  By myself, it’s quick to make coffee but with others a pot of tea is easier.


Coffee stinks, hate the smell of it.


At work I drink coffee and home its tea but I prefer water mostly due to the sports activities I do.


You don't need a teapot every time to make one you know! Just stick a teabag in a mug and wait for it to stew. I mean, its the same as coffee as you have to wait for it to cool down anyway 😄



	 





	 



	Disgraceful.



	 





	 



	I'd love to find a coffee that isn't like drinking a Cig, so good luck with that one....and Earl Grey can get in the deepest darkest hole in the ground.



	 





	 



	Don't mix. Just do Tea, Paulo.



	 





	 



	I always knew you were the brightest one of the bunch 😎


Firstly i feel i speak for all that its BS i can only pick one 😂😂 i love coffee and alcohol equally and Occasionally at the same time ❤


I don't drink tea or coffee. I do drink a lot of diet coke though


Coffee in the morning and never after mid day because it sticks around in your system for quite a long time.



	 



	I hate drinking water on its own so I always have juice with it.



	 



	Tea can fuck off.


I genuinely drink about 4-5 litres of water a day, it's actually a problem but I genuinely love how refreshing it is. 



	 



	I love Tea and Coffee but it I was forced to choose I'd have to go with a good old fashioned shitty cup of tea! (In an FG Mug of course)


Who hurt you?


Who hurt you as well? We will ship  you beans, I'm assuming you don't have a grinder and appropriate making paraphernalia?


I also love that from a country that started a global empire over tea, who make fun of countries who "make houses out of wood", can't muster up enough effort to source, grind and brew good coffee. Hi pot, my name is kettle...


The fact that a country that started a global empire over tea... can't seem to actually brew a proper pot of tea without using a horrendous tea bag... is in itself also hilarious.



	 



	@Gxxxa Garratt - We're half tempted to include tea and coffee in a shipment to you... How can you hate Earl Grey? What about a vanilla laced Earl Grey? It's also one of those teas that need a little milk.


We don't need to...cos its shit. We made Tea, so we stick to Tea. Everyone else here clearly has a problem and I'd question where they were actually born - now your roots, or at least tea leaves.



	 





	 



	


	 



	What have I started....


When will we have to start calling you Gummy Bear, Thomas? I'm so glad I toned down the fizzy pop some years ago, I used to be the same!


Tea is the Cigarette to the Cigar of coffee...less flavor and not quite as manly....


Tea in leaves in a pot, with a tea strainer, is the best tea. Tea bags have come a long way though so I'm not fussy. English breakfast, the blended variety, be it PG Tips, Yorkshire etc etc only. Earl Grey is poison.



	I worked in am RAF canteen on Saturdays when is was 14 and I'll never forget the smell of rancid coffee cups waiting to be washed. Tea don't stink at any stage...unless you are a ponce who likes to drink perfume.



	And back with coffee, if I wanted that kind of buzz, I'd just do a line of speed🤗


This is not how science works...caffeine is caffeine and 1:1 tea has more. The method does extract additional from the coffee bean and we use more coffee grind for a cup. If you used the same amount of tea as you would for a cup of coffee then it would give you more of a "buzz".


My issue with tea bags is 1) paper taste. I can't stand it. 2) it's actually woven with some plastic as well. No thank you. 3) tea leaves don't expand as well in a bag.



	 



	Also, has anyone here tried tea from TWG Tea? I have an assortment, and I'm enjoying them. They have so many different blends for Earl Grey too. I question whether all you Earl Grey haters just haven't had a properly brewed cup with a touch of milk!



	 



	As for the rancid coffee cups, hahaha.. I'm going to guess a majority of those cups were filled with milk and coffee.. not just straight, black coffee!



	 





	 



	And.. hush you. Tea has infinitely more flavors and notes available than coffee ever will. There's only so many times you can use "chocolate" as a note in a beverage! Sometimes, I like my drink a bit fruity or having notes of rice krispies or some vanilla or orange...



	 



	All notes that you have to really strive to taste in coffee.



	 



	There's no effort in tasting them in tea. 😄


Freshly cut garden hose...


Plus, I mentally associate coffee drinkers with angry people 😂


Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh


Fuck off




As for coffee drinkers in a car, don't get me started 😅


I have recently started making my own iced caramel machiatos.



	 



	The offset that the wife made me a bowl full of long Island iced tea at the weekend 👍


Starbucks is next to my filling station of choice 😂


Coffee all day every day.  I don't drink Starbucks or anything of that shit.  Just black coffee.




This has been on my list since it was announced.  Comes out April 30th.


This looks THE one. An actual PS5 game that will knock your socks off. Seen some early reviews and gameplay and i'm massively impressed. I'm not overly great with horror games as it has a bit of that linked to it but its worth crossing the comfort zone line to pick this up. The worlds are procedurally generated too, and apparently its Rogue-Lite so probably also for the people that like torture as you die you lose nearly everything. I want to get just for the PS5 controller usage as its apparently one of the best ones to show it off since launch too.


Early impressions...  housemarque has done it again.  This game is really friggin good.  Controls are crisp and fluid.  Visuals and audio are top notch. Gameplay is tight.  If you’re a fan of rouge lites such as hades then you’ll dig this one.  You will die a lot.  

	 



	My only gripe and it’s really not a game breaker in any way, is there can be a LOT going on at any given time.  Due to the third person perspective, you tend to get ambushed and surrounded quickly.  Most of housemarques games have had an arcadey bullethell kind of vibe and it seems they tried to add a bit of that to this.  It doesn’t really blend well but like I said, minor gripe.  

	 



	This is truly a next gen experience.  The dual sense integration is really nice to.  And example is you feel the rain drops hitting your suit through the controller.  

	 



	🤘🏻


I've played an hour or two so far, think you've summed it up perfectly.



	 



		The game feels like how you expected a PS5 game to feel. Subtle haptic feedback, runs really smooth, audio is fantastic. 
	
	
		Wouldn't classify it as a 'horror' per say, more just a couple of unsettling moments.
	
	
		There's a lot of loot initially, different in game currencies etc. There's a fair bit of information to take in as to what does what, but I'm sure I'll figure it out as I play more.
	

	Really enjoyed what I've played so far though!




It's no secret that when I buy something, I research the hell out of it and get a product and/or brand that aligns as close as possible to my ethos and to the quality I want... and price... price is a factor.



	 



	When @Txxxo R56 Mini  and I were renovating the game room, we knew what our setup was sort of going to look like. Once COVID quarantine hit, getting various pieces in place became a bigger priority. I didn't want an ugly ass computer chair... and those IG/home magazine photo worthy chairs are really just dining chairs and don't work for what we need.



	 



	I didn't want to spend $1500 on a Herman Miller chair either.



	 



	So, we landed on Secret Lab. Fantastic quality. Not a "one size fits all". Smaller company.



	 



	Now, they announced their computer desk! Such thoughtful features especially for cable management.



	 



	If I sound excited and super plug-y... it's because I'm super excited about the design features even though we will not be buying one (our custom walnut table/desk was designed to fit perfectly in the room, and we see no point in swapping it out).



	 



	But for those of you are are looking for a computer desk... I share their Magnus: https://secretlab.co/pages/magnus-metal-desk



	 



	Really such thoughtful features!


Yes i believe crispy does this aswell it drives me and Jo crazy but we like to call jt spreadsheeting @cxxxxxxxxxxn




Yeah, it will not let me use the same email as it has been used, tried. Lol


Well, basically, it goes like this. I had an email account "gloverjohndavid1990@yxxxxxxxx" and was deactivated by Yahoo due to inactivity... Meaning I hadn't logged onto it for quite some time but my phone and computer are both signed onto it... 



	 



	My Sony account used this email and I was able to contact them and get it updated to a new email. My activision account is also linked to this old email account but now they want me to sign into the account and I don't remember the password. I can't change the password because due to the email being deactivated, I can't access it to change the password. 



	 



	Needless to say, my account seems to be gone now. Activision has NO CONTACT NUMBER for me to call to fix things. Does ANYONE know what I can do?



	 



	I have gone to the support site and followed the link "screenshot below" and it doesn't work. Please someone help, I think COD is a gonner for me. I'm not very computer literate but I've researched what I can. I've even called Yahoo to reactivate the email and they said it's gone, they can't help. 



	 



	I'm not starting over on COD so if I can't get my account back then I'm done.


Phew. Don't panic.



	 



	Let me dig around and see if I can find some resolution options for you.



	 



	While I do that, hopefully someone else can answer...


Try doing this from a PC... because it just makes it less frustrating. Let me know how far you get. Go through the support options. Pick the game and platform.



	 



	Go here: https://support.activision.com/options



	 



	 



	Click the appropriate options (FYI, I clicked "I'm unable to access my Activision Account" to get to the screen after this; scroll past the image):



	 



	



	 



	I want you to get here:



	 



	



	 



	Click the "Account Recovery Request" and get to:



	 



	



	 



	Let me know what happens after this... like if you can resolve your locked out issue or not. Take screenshots along the way, so I can see what you did if I have to go further.


Thats a great find La, nice one. John, have you tried reactivate the email address at all? Your emails have been deleted but the email account is not deleted.



	 



	Found this on Yahoo.



	 



	



	 



	You should be able to grab your old password from your browser password store in settings.



	 



	I'm only suggesting this as if we can get you into your email account it sounds like it'll save everything.
