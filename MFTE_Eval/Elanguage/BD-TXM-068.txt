20/12/2020, 3:07 am - $I: Narrated by $S3P1: He said, "The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: You refrain from making it. The idea is big lying. Do not look at the blame, do not spell, and do not jealousy, do not be an admilison, and do not be confused with each other. Rather, you are all the people of God's brother.

21/12/2020, 5:13 am - $G: One of my colleague 's three ships sank in one day.  Going to pick up those three ships, what was deposited in the bank also went away.  But not a single ship was rescued.  A millionaire is destitute in an instant!
 
 A rich man from Chandpur used to cover his face in front of the mosque after prayers.  Just keep getting hands, don't say anything in shame.  The two hands given to people all their lives are now given to people.  After breaking everything, the giant river swallowed the soil.
 
 Spot death of everyone in a micro bus in a road accident. The husband, wife and their only son were in the car, just passing varsity. Will marry the boy, the girl was going home to see. All the owners of the five-story house in Dhaka city are now in the grave. Relatives are now fighting over possession of the house. Who takes possession of the house!
 
 $S3P2 is a very accountable man.  The whole life is going according to plan.  The health insurance that he had for medical treatment in his old age did not work either.  Such an illness has been caught that all the money is gone.  Now it is a risk to sell the house.  The boys won't.  How long will the old man live, sell the house and sit all the way or not!
 
 How many such incidents are happening in front of all of us.  We are watching and filling the bank with our eyes closed.  How much trouble we have for a secure future!  But wealth is never a guarantee of future security.  We know but do not believe.  The hardest reality is that the more he wants to live on his wealth, the more God makes him dependent on his wealth.
 
 You are so high today with your hard work, talent and education, this idea is wrong.  We forget God's mercy.  How many qualified people are below me!
 
 On the way to pick up the child from school in the morning, by lowering the glass of the car, your son could have come running to get the begging that your son gives to the boy of the same age.  And it won't take long for him to move from the current situation if he wants to.  We are arrogant, and we forget.
 
 Most of the wealthy people want to live by grabbing the wealth by forgetting the one who gave it.  Suffers from ingratitude and egoism.
 
 But the poor and backward people call on Allah more, humbly and rely only on Allah.
 
 People are very ungrateful.

 Those who trust should put their trust in God.

 I once again appeal to all the circle brothers and sisters of this group stationed in the country and abroad  To stand by the disadvantaged people of their village during this severe winter

 I wish everyone good health

28/12/2020, 11:21 pm - $D:  Afiz Mia expressed interest as a candidate for member post from our village in the upcoming elections.  And on the occasion of the English New Year, greetings and greetings should be received by the villagers.  Have you ever wondered what would happen if two people from one group (i.e. you and Abduruf) contested the election?  I think the result will definitely be zero.  That means it will be impossible for both of you to become a member.  Therefore, I request both of you to be a member of the party only if you or one of the two is reluctant to win.

01/01/2021, 6:11 am - $Y: Leaving 1 year means less than 1 year from our life, approaching death, decreasing the time of repentance.
 What is there to express so much joy in it ???
 
 We should regret that we have not been able to use the time that has passed, we have not been able to repent and forgive our sins, we have not been able to benefit others, we have not been able to perform the prayers on time, we have not been able to correct ourselves.  ..
 
  for all that I have gained and all that I have lost.
 Every day, every hour, every minute, every second is a blessing given to us by Allah.
 
 May God guide us all, correct the mistakes and grant us the grace to come to the right path.

15/01/2021, 7:38 pm - $E: The pond of  is a very old tradition, a pond with many memories, a natural reservoir.  It costs up to  of rupees to build a small reservoir in a city mosque.  Where a little renovation could have been a unique, extraordinarily beautiful azure place.  And if we think commercially, the mosque environment will be ruined and the market environment will be created.  Moreover, it is unthinkable that it became so urgent.  Whatever it was everyone wanted, I just expressed my passion and reasoning.  However, no one can achieve business purpose on the occasion of the mosque. The call and expectation to be aware of all.

If there are some shops, the income of the mosque will be.  For this, a master plan has been made long ago.
