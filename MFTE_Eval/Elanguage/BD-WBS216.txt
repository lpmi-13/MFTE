It is easy to find yourself getting caught up in work when you are focusing on your career. Maybe you started your career as a software engineer or web developer and you feel the need to prove yourself. Or you are close to promotion and you‚Äôre going for the last push to reach it. Whatever the reason may be for you to be spending all your time working, you‚Äôll realize that you do need work-life balance at some point. It is not viable to continually be working. This post will motivate you to learn about work-life balance and to put it into practice.
If you really start practicing in your life the results will be great so far and that is what we are going to share with you in this post.
1. Higher Productivity
The mistake people made was thinking that if they weren‚Äôt coding then they were not working. This leads to keep working for a long time and view taking breaks and taking time away from work as being unproductive. But changing your working style can help your work-life balance. Start began to take frequent breaks and take time off. Then you will find that you are actually more productive than you were before enforcing work-life balance.
2. Stronger Relationships
It‚Äôs difficult to make time for your friends and family when you‚Äôre constantly working. When you establish a work-life balance you‚Äôre able to use some of that time to build up your relationships with your friends and family. Having stronger relationships can increase your overall level of happiness which boosts your productivity at work.
3. Improved Health and Well-Being

You increment your risk of RSI (repetitive strain injury). At the point when you work less and set aside that effort to revive, it helps by improving your health and well-being.
It helps prevents the danger of RSI, which is career breaking for a software engineer or developer. It also helps you maintain your mental health, which is critical to do your job as a software developer.
4. Prioritize tasks
Not everything is equally important. It‚Äôs usually okay if some things don‚Äôt get done. Spend time on the important tasks to have the most impact.
5. Prevents Burnout
Working too much is definitely a path to burnout. When you‚Äôre burnout you lose interest and motivation. It reduces your energy and productivity, leaving you feeling hopeless, helpless, and resentful. These negative effects will touch every area of your life including work, home, and social life.
By having a work-life balance you can prevent yourself from entering a burnout state.

Islamic Relief is helping children work towards achieving their dreams. Like most children, Shiria Khatun used to think about what she might do as an adult. But unlike many children in the world, her options were limited. Shiria, 17, was just a baby when her father was struck my lightning and died. He was the main earner in the family and Shiria, her mother, and her three older sisters struggled to find the money to eat. Shiria‚Äôs mother made contact with Islamic Relief when Shiria was nine, and she was signed up to the One-to-One Orphan Sponsorship Programme for children who have lost one or both parents. As part of this scheme, Shiria was supported through school, where she blossomed. She was also able to join the Scouts and have extra IT lessons. A moment to remember Now, 11 years later, Shiria has just received results for the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) from her college in Rajbari, in central Bangladesh. She was awarded a Grade Point Average of 5, which is the highest mark possible. She said: ‚ÄúThis is one of the best moments of my life. This sort of happiness and good news comes very rarely in our life. It happened only because of the support of Islamic Relief and its donors.‚Äù Shiria is now hoping to go to university and study to be an accountant. Her mother Aysha Begum said: ‚ÄúThis is a memorable day for my family. Now I would likeShiria to complete her higher education and thrive.‚Äù Shiria was one of 32 students sponsored by Islamic Relief in Bangladesh who attained their HSC this year. She was one of three to gain the top grade of 5. There are around 153 million orphans in the world today. Many are orphaned by war, natural disaster, and illness, and without one or both parents, are more vulnerable to a childhood of hunger, poverty and insecurity. Islamic Relief sponsors around 43,500 orphans across the world. This scheme means they have a roof over their heads and food on their plates. They go to school with books and stationery, and when they get unwell, they are provided with healthcare, vaccinations and medicine.
They receive Eid presents and attend summer camps, sports classes and fun day trips. A social worker visits their home regularly to make sure they are safe and happy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a critical blow to all business operations worldwide with most businesses brought down to a dead halt and others being forced to operate under severe restrictions. Call centers throughout the world have suffered from a massive blow from a double-edged sword. They are fielding in more calls from customers inquiring about online orders or services. But many of the people who would answer those calls either can‚Äôt get to work or are not equipped to work from home. Call volumes have sky rocketed - particularly for banks, financial service providers, e-commerce platforms, and health service providers. But the number of available agents have reduced significantly. Most of the call center service providers are either shutting down or downsizing amid containment efforts. Most big companies have put up a warning message in bright colors and large fonts at the top of their website - stating the limitations of customer support imposed by the shortage of support staff during the pandemic.
As businesses grapple with the economic impact of this pandemic, customer call centers are dealing with the people side of things. Call centers are not only experiencing a surge in call volumes, but also having to deal with more complex calls. Consumers will be calling in for more varied, involved and complex issues. Call duration is expected to increase by a large margin. Target abandonment rates will likely rise by a large margin, particularly due to the long wait in IVR. During this 'never seen before' unique situation, AI and chatbots are gaining more terrain. IBM saw a 40% increase in traffic to Watson Assistant from February to April of this year. But human to human interaction still remains the most desired form of communication when requiring support for a product or service.
Understanding the gravity of the situation at hand, we here at ISSL had been working tirelessly to shift our operations to a 'work from home' friendly approach since the beginning of official lockdown that started back in March. Facilitating our regular call center operations in a remote environment had been a gargantuan task but by the end of April, we had managed to shift most of our operations. Right from the beginning of lockdown, all our efforts had been focused towards this transition.
Within the first month of lockdown, we had shipped almost 100 laptops and an equal number of headsets to our agents. We also ensured high bandwidth internet connectivity for smooth call flow. Setting up these laptops would have been a breeze for the IT Support team, only if they were in the office! Contact center solution and CRM used by iSSL are both developed by our in-house software development team. Both these systems are cloud based which means they can be accessed from anywhere through a secure link. Remotely setting up the laptops, CRM and real time monitoring for supervisors and quality management team had been a daunting task for the IT Support team. We utilized remote desktop solutions like AnyDesk and painstakingly set up these laptops one by one remotely.
Next challenge was to establish the processes governing call center operations along with the associated teams that are participating in these processes. Efficient call center operation involves multiple teams within the value chain like CC agents, team leads, real time monitoring and reporting team that handles CRM data, training team, recruitment team, quality management team and last but not the least - the IT support team. All these teams needed to shift their regular operational and communication activities in an online environment, all the while remaining under lockdown restrictions.
Countless calls and online meetings took place among different teams in order to mitigate the technical challenges and to bridge the communication gap in online avenues. We managed to shift our day to day supervision, monitoring, task and roster management, and quality control activities in an online space by utilizing online meeting applications and our sheer dedication to keep things afloat. Scheduled meetings, proactive planning and a ‚Äòservice first‚Äô approach have allowed us not only to keep day to day operational activities afloat but also to effectively manage recruitment and training activities for new CC agents.
All of our call center services are currently up and running with our trained and efficient agents providing 24/7 support through our secured cloud interface. This pandemic situation calls for a more vigilant presence and a higher quality of support for customers who are being forced to conduct day to day tasks from the confinements of their home. By ensuring Omni channel connectivity, we are committed to provide best in class support for our customers during this difficult time.
