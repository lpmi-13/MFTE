My friend trevo using a mobile postpaid connection  can I share my credit to my friend trevo from my prepaid account?




Hi, yes you can chose the package from the link given in the above comment. Nowadays Dialog has variety of packages for us depending on our requirements. anyway, to purchase a new connection, unfortunately, Dialog has not introduced an alternative to purchase a mobile online yet. Because the connection holder has to place the signature in the application form. so it is mandatory for the connection holder to visit the nearest Dialog outlet with their NIC.




I will be flying to UK tommorow and i want to know if I can use data while on flight and will I be charged normal charges or what will be the charges?


if your connection is a prepaid mobile connection the roaming service will be active by default if so you could recharge the connection and use the in-flight service since the roaming service is active in your connection.however, you would have to activate a roaming data plan before using the in flight service. If your connection is postpaid connection you will not be able to use the roaming service without activating the roaming service and a data plan in order to use the in flight roaming data please refer below link for more details on Data Roaming plans. https://www.dialog.lk/data-roaming-plans




Hi, as per my knowledge the owner has to visit a Dialog outlet. Since you are abroad you will need to provide a letter signed by you together with the copy of NIC / PP and one of your friend/family member could provide this to the outlet and obtain the SIM. The letter should contain the bearer’s NIC number, name and for verification purposes. Further, you could contact Dialog whatsapp on 0777 678 678 for further assistance.
