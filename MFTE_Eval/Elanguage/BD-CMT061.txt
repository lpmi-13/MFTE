Our youth force is an asset and we should utilize this force for productive work - learning from China may be a worthy source of experience. If our youth force becomes productive source then our volatile economy will become a stable one for continued growth. Shazzad

Commend you for weaving a profoundly educative article on where the success lies in product marketing. The budding etrepreuners and busisenss executives will benefit immensely from the article. It twill help them put their marketing acts together successfully. Also, it's great to know the tremendous success you have achieved in your professional life by strictly practicing the basic marketing tenets and human qualities. Congratulations!!!

Fiscal policies can generate growth. However, in countries with high levels of government corruption, bribes and graft then monetary policy can be a wise decision. Bangladesh has repeatedly been near the top of international examination of corruption. I always believe in the people, innovation, entrepreneurship as the driving force of economic growth. However, this needs to be tempered with redistribution of income via taxes as businesses are profit motive and not always concerned with the welfare of the population.




Why the business should pay advance tax on the imports and raise burden on the consumers? What benefit we will get from the payment of advance tax except rise of cost for all of us?

China has money - why not take their help?


Bangladesh can benefit immensely from the South Asian and SouthEastern development and mega projects already in place in Bangladesh from Japan and China. However, Bangladesh should be friendly to all nations and enemy to none this includes amicable Australia. Economic fiscal spending and investment will help the fallouts from Covid-19, the desperately poor, the students, and the economy at large.

Yes, three things should and could be done: (a) moving to increased use of synthetic fibres, (b) moving to increased production of higher value items and (c) promoting the "green- product" branding in the global market.


This crying, begging, requesting and complaining about the price drop has been going on for last few years. Such amateur and unprofessional technics will not yield in any price increase. You need to up your negotiation game by several folds because you are dealing with world class procurement experts employed by the global brands to reduce costs.


You are looking at one side of the puzzle, in recent years, west african countries and south east asian countries have been developing a competitive advantage in the garments industry which is superior to that of Banlgadesh. Having more players entering the industy is causing the prices to drop. If you want to achieve a higher price for your product you need to think about a different strategy which offers more quality products at a premium price. In a globalized economy, you either have to stay competitive or deplete away and make room for others.




A great start by the new president of BGMEA! She has hit the nail on the head of the crucial internal measures needed to be taken by the local apparel industry, to face the ill practices of the international buyer's cartels. Mere appeals to fairness have done little to improve the dismal price paid by the cartels for the products they procure to resell at exorbitant profits in the world's retail markets.

Highly inspired to read the BSMSN being developed into one of the largest Economic Zones where the reporter has laid open the Govt's initiative to develop it into multi-faceted or multi-purpoese industrial establishments with investors from home & abroad.More pleased to hear from the Executive Chairman, despite COVID-19 pandemic, its expansion & growth rate are still uninterrupted.Looking for information from the authority. Is it located at seashore Miraswari or at nearby island Sandwip? The learned reporter was perhaps overwhelmed to see its expansion so quickly. Hence the basic information of its geographical location failed to draw his attention.Hopefully, he will not miss next time.




Thanks for sharing this wonderful information.


Well, to be honest, it is not the country or the purchase but the extension that makes the difference. Think of someone having to type a 6 letter extension. It's tough to type the whole thing, isn't it.
Similarly for .bd, it doesn't have a great combination and hence, the adoption is low.
In fact, many of the discussions on NamePros revolve around the adoption of new gTLD or cctld and a lot of them do not take off. .CO did, .IO did because of its appeal to some other community, instead of its demand in the country itself.
What's your thought on this?

We can continue to rise with a low-skill low-wage economy only for so long. Others with even lower wages can and will out-compete us as our wages grow. We have to be ready to transition to a higher-wage higher-skill economy like the East Asian countries have. But this requires better quality education than our leaders realize. Rote learning based on limited syllabus and limited set of exam questions has to give way to a more comprehensive learning that expands critical thinking of youngsters. The optimistic forecast has no chance to materialize if this significant component is not in place. There are a few encouraging private initiatives in the educational front, but the government has to play a much more supportive role in terms of policies.


Excellent economy of Bangladesh





Better not project this way. Those countries have the natural resource water. Some of them pirated water from the downstream country's ecosystems. Would this reporter understand the importance of water and the current state of this resource, he would not be this much exceedingly optimistic. It should be a natural understanding that a resource outsourced country's economy cannot be at par with resource pirating countries. It sounds like comparing apples with oranges.

Great news of setting up a fully automated dairy farm. Hearty kudos to the entreprenuers. This initiative will generate a lot of positives, including our per capita protein intake, technology and animal husbandry knowhow transfer, job creation, et all. We are inspired. Some others can also invest and emulate. We are turning the corner, sure.

very good we need to adapt modern farming too


More intensive farming is needed but always with good farming husbandry. The welfare of the animal is always testament credibility. Bangladesh should not also forget about GM, genetically modified farming when tested thoroughly so it increases yield and with less chance of new pathogens being introduced to the food chain. This does not mean traditional small scale farming, local farming should be neglected. There is evidence of good wellbeing and lower cost especially transportation cost. This is the same for organic farming where people trust old and trusted methods of farming. Again, said to increase wellbeing, but organic farming always tends to cost a lot more. However, Bangladesh may need to increase crop yields to feed its large population so GM and good intensive farming methods may need to be adopted.

India never helped Bangladesh without their major interests. There are many projects in Bangladesh done by China very successfully. China is capable to work for the projects. India take help from China for their own development. India's attitude towards neighbors are very bad. When you see that your neighbors are not happy with you, it means you have basic problems.
