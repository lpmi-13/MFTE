The safety of our student and staff community will always be our top priority. As a result, this academic year (2020/21), the majority of assessments will take place online.
We have been working hard to develop a suite of adapted forms of assessment to ensure all students are able to fully demonstrate the knowledge and skills you have developed over the course of the year in a fair and reliable way.
For most of you, the details of assessments given in your module handbooks won’t change. We’ve already planned for the majority of assessments to be online this academic year, or to happen safely and in line with COVID-19 social distancing requirements.
For a small number of you, we’ll be making some changes to your assessments. Where this is the case, we’ll let you know the details of these changes with plenty of time for you to prepare.
Written examinations on campus in most cases will have been replaced by online, time-limited open book assessment, unless a Professional Statutory Regulatory Body overseeing your programme requires otherwise.
In class presentations may be replaced by online presentations
Coursework and dissertations will continue online
Portfolios will become e-portfolios
Practical assessments (e.g. lab work or studio-based assessments) may remain on campus where safe
It’s critical that you use these adapted forms of assessments to demonstrate academic integrity by producing your own work, clearly acknowledging any material that has been included from other sources or through collaboration.
As always, you must also present your own findings, conclusions or data based on appropriate and ethical practice.
By demonstrating these values of honesty, fairness and respect for others and their work, you will achieve real and lasting pride in your work.
The University has developed an online course called Becoming a Successful Student to ensure you are able to do all of the above. You can find this resource by logging into MyUniHub and then going to My Learning. You will find the course under ‘My courses’. The course is designed to help you:
There may be difficult circumstances in your life that affect your ability to meet an assessment deadline or affect your performance in an assessment. These are known as Extenuating Circumstances or ECs. Extenuating Circumstances are exceptional, unforeseen, seriously adverse and outside of your control.
To apply for Extenuating Circumstances (ECs), you must submit a completed Extenuating Circumstances Form.
For Postgraduate Taught Dissertations due in October 2020, students wanting a deferral to the next assessment period (Jan 2021) will have this automatically granted and there is no need to complete an Extenuating Circumstances Form.
You can find more details about how this process works on the Extenuating Circumstances UniHub page.
There are so many resources at your fingertips to ensure you've got everything you need to successfully complete any assessments, and indeed any online learning, from home.
If you don’t think you have a suitable space at home for learning and/or completing assessments, then please reach out to your academics who will discuss how this can be improved and if necessary, will consider your circumstances when designing your adapted assessments.
Laptop Loans
If you don't have your own PC, laptop or suitable device to access the University online environment, the University will provide you with a loan laptop to help you with your teaching and assessment needs.
All laptops have full desktop software installed, printing functionality, on screen sign-in instructions and can be used on or off campus.
To borrow a laptop, simply raise a ticket with UniHelp.
In response to student feedback, we developed both an Anonymous Marking and Lecture Recording policy. You can view the Anonymous Marking Assessment Policy online, and watch our video around Anonymous Marking, by logging into MyLearning, clicking on the Help link in the top red bar, navigating to the Student Essentials area, and expanding the Turnitin section.
Anonymous marking ensures that your identity (your name, student number and other personal/identifiable information) is not made available to academics when they are marking your work.
Anonymous marking will be used for assessments that contribute to your final mark for a module (summative assessments), wherever this is possible in terms of teaching and assessment approaches and practicality.
It is important to note that there are some cases where anonymous marking is not possible or practical. In these cases, and like all other universities, we rely on moderation processes, second marking, and external examiner oversight to assure standards, impartiality, fairness and to reduce potential bias.
So that you can re-visit any learning materials, most of your lectures and taught sessions will be recorded to support self-paced learning. Some sessions however may not be appropriate to record such as those where personal information might be disclosed such as during personal tutoring, tutorials, and sessions where discussion activity might involve the sharing of personal experience
Any recorded content will be uploaded to My Learning so that you are easily able to access it.
Your academics will notify you at the beginning of a session if they are going to record and ensure you are OK with being recorded – if you do not wish to appear on the recording or have your voice heard, you should let them know at this point.
We recommend that you utilise lecture recordings as a resource to review content covered within your modules.





At Once, There Was No Horizon, the new album from Vieo Abiungo (side project of the unique and prolific William Ryan Fritch) comes nearly ten years after the release of the project’s debut, a record which started Fritch’s long-term partnership with Lost Tribe Sound. The album forms part of Built Upon A Fearful Void, a series of fifteen albums that Lost Tribe will release periodically over the next year or so, both digitally and on beautifully designed CDs. Following four previous Vieo Abiungo albums, as well as near countless under his own name, At Once, There Was No Horizon sees Fritch continue to create what we’ve referred to previously as his “raggedly beautiful experimental music,” a dark alter ego of anything you might expect to find in the ambient and modern classical fields.
Te album ss “an expanse of impressionistic tonal color,” Lost Tribe explains, “where elliptical patterns of horns, reeds, bowed metals and the ecstatic chatter of unfamiliar percussion cluster, rise and decay.” Fritch weaves this panoply of elements into something peculiar yet organic, conjuring an experience at once menacingly ominous and lushly evocative. You awaken in the shambling fever dream of ‘Balkanize’, amygdala visions of a reeling forest canopy illuminated in stark torchlight. The reedy flutes join a malarial chorus of clicks and clacks that circle in a wicked dance, and woodwind groans like laboured lungs, a faraway melody snaking like candleflame in the night.
The album continues in this vein, Fritch again demonstrating his ability to call forth worlds of his own making to create music that defies any conventional description. ‘Unfulfilled Promise’ grows in intensity towards a cathartic midpoint, while ‘A Cold Calculus’ unfurls in a lazy writhing motion, skittering percussion scuttling from the corners like paranoid thoughts. Remaining relatively subdued throughout, it’s part somber, part sinister, but fades into a white glow that feels neither, resisting the urge to throw off its shackles and erupt in noise.
The title track is a journey into an unknown, perhaps toward some strange destination deep in the folds of the brain rather than anywhere physical. Galloping percussion rattles across a wash of tone and texture, giddy horns mewling and whispering from within the murk. Beyond the halfway point there’s a hush, the whole track falling away to a tribal shuffle and oppressive negative space. Then the far-off moan of a ghostly choir approaches and suddenly you’ve been turned around, find yourself right back where you started.
Closer ‘Empty Heroics’, the record’s longest track at just over ten minutes, proceeds on its own path. Encapsulating the entire album, it shifts from the near-devotional choral quality of its opening to menacing stomps of sound and beguiling negative space. By the halfway mark bedraggled percussion has shuffled in, a junkyard beat that ebbs and flows in unlikely rhythm, an orchestra of rattles, thuds and scrapes that Fritch reanimates and directs to his bidding. Nobody else makes music quite like it. Here’s to ten more years of Vieo Abiungo.
At Once, There Was No Horizon is out 16th October on Lost Tribe Sound and you can get it via the William Ryan Fritch Bandcamp page. Alternatively, subscribe to Lost Tribe’s Built Upon a Fearful Void series to get the album as one of 15 releases over the coming months.



Reasons against a vasectomy
You have decided it may be the time to have a vasectomy and you have come to this website to book a vasectomy. In the next few minutes I will try to change your mind and tell you not to have a vasectomy:
The 3 most important question you need to discuss with your partner are these:
- What happens if our relationship splits and somebody else wants children with you (common in western societies)
- You or your partner change your mind (occasionally happens to existing couples)
- something happens to one of your children (rare, but important for younger couples).
If you do not have a current partner you need to be aware, that failure to warn a partner of your vasectomy would almost certainly mean your partner would be granted a divorce with all the implications.
When thinking about this procedure also consider the following:
- Have I really sat down with my partner and considered all alternatives? Click here for some of the very good alternative methods. Sometimes it is just worth to wait a little bit longer before going ahead. Some of the longer acting contraceptive methods i.e. the coil or an implant can postpone such a decision safely for some time.
- Am I now of an age where I don’t want any children anymore, whatever happens?
- Have I got enough children or are there still some secret wishes in me or my partner?
- If my life changed and reversal was not successful would adoption be an alternative I can consider?
- Am I of an age where I should consider freezing sperm?
- Am I so worried about vasectomy, it’s not really an option? There are good female alternatives available now. It’s not the end of the world if you don’t really want to do it. If you have read the clinical and the personal FAQs of this website and you are still not reassured you may wish to reconsider the above.
Contraindications to vasectomy:
- Intrascrotal Hernia (needs fixing first) and
- Lack of Mental Capacity (Note: Court order needed, which has to be initiated by the person with Power of Attorney for Medical Care)
Increased risk of problems, disappointment or regret:
There are a number of important clinical issues we need to know in order to be able to counsel you appropriately and avoid disappointment.
- Very obese patients (BMI over 35): Can sometimes be difficult to operate on and have higher infection rates. We recommend a prior appointment for assessment.
- Diabetic patients (need good HbA1c control to avoid postoperative complications). Infection rates are higher in patients with poor HbA1c control. If you are poorly controlled we probably recommend perioperative antibiotics, but even those do not always avoid infection. You should have a prior appointment for assessment.
- Smokers have a 400% higher infection risk in all procedures. We recommend to stop smoking at least 3-4 weeks before vasectomy. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22566015. We currently believe vaping is better than smoking.
- Certain personality types:Patients, who have great anxiety about the procedure, feeling forced into it or feeling very negative about the whole prospect or are generally mistrusting: These patients tend to not do always well and are at high risk of PVP (post vasectomy pain or other regrets ).Type A personalities, the need for control: This can include patients, who want to know every single detail about the procedure and worry greatly in advance. This sometimes also shows in other ways: A need to control every single aspect of their lives and focus on minute detail, they are unable to hand over control and mistrust the doctor or nurse or health professionals in general.PTSD patients: A previous bad health experience has caused post traumatic stress (PTSD): This also increases the risk of post-vasectomy problems.Scatty, disorganised patients & bad listeners: Some patients are scatty and generally disorganised, they cannot listen to others, they fail to read information, absorb information we are forwarding or balance information with their own (mis)conceptions or beliefs. This failure leads in turn to anxiety as they remain uninformed. Sometimes they rather research google, again because of mistrust of “official” information.Official mental health conditions: Depression and Personality Disorders can negatively affect outcomes and patient satisfaction.Patients who are “too busy”: Other issues that ring alarm bells with us are frequent appointment changes (“too busy at work” = anxiety, unwilling to engage) or non-attendance of the consultation / procedure and failure to complete the forms we send (which are quite educational and again mean patients have not had a chance to inform themselves in a structured way).The good news: However, just because a patient has a mental health condition like i.e. depression or anxiety it does not mean they will not do well with a vasectomy. The above information is very specific.
- Coagulation disorders (i.e. van Willebrands etc. or prior bleeding problems at other surgical interventions): This is very important as it can cause significant bleeding and side effects and a medical opinion has to be sought prior to vasectomy.
- Absence of a vas deferens (uncommon, patients should be scanned beforehand to ensure no renal agenesis)
- Third Vas Deferens (this can easily be missed and can cause a failure, fortunately it is uncommon)
- Testicular cancer (very rare, not an absolute contraindication, but probably best to fix first)
- History of fainting (only extreme cases cause problems, but it is important to know, so we can prepare)
- Young patients (<25y) with children and patients without children (<30y): Higher statistical risk of regret*.
*Please complete the Young Patient Form, which will help you to go systematically through your thought processes and us to understand your reasons)
And why should I be the one to have a vasectomy?
If safety is paramount, vasectomy is perfect (but if non-permanent contraception is needed the female Implant may be similarly good and other long acting methods are also interesting). A man, who has had children or definitely never wanted any and is of an age, where (further) children would be a real burden is an ideal candidate for vasectomy. If you want to be in control of your destiny and it is clear to you there shall definitely be no more children with anybody. If you like your wife to be able to stop using hormonal contraception and the above applies, too, then vasectomy is also an excellent choice.
The choice is yours…
