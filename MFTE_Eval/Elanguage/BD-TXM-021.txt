Bangladesh Bank has ordered the two Mobile Financing Services Bkash and Nagad to stop spreading disinformation about one another. The central authority had previously warned the two services about violating the publicity policy of the ICT ministry, which both the parties have been doing so far. A spokesperson for the bank has said that they would take action against the activities of these two parties in light of the publicity policy.
