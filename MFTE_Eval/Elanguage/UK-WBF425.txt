Decided to replace the memory with 2 x 8Gb DDR3 1866 Dimms which are compatible with the M/b.  However, PC will not boot.  The CPU and case fans spin up for a few seconds and then it stops.   It continues to cycle thru this again an again without ever booting.     If I add one of the older 2  1333 DIMMS ie 18Gb in all, the PC boots detecting the three modules, but running at 1333 MHz.   Remove the 2Gb DIMM and it wont boot with only the 2 x 8Gb DIMMS.   I am not using the suspect socket.



I thought maybe the M/b was not recognising the 1866 MHz DIMMS, but the BIOS settings are set to auto and it should detect anything up to 2133.

Sounds like it doesnt like the timings on the new ram but once you put the old stick in its defaulting to the slowest sticks timings. You tried setting xmp with the 2gb stick in then removing it, or manually set timings/voltage the same as the slow stick then remove.



Either way sounds like the ram is good you just need to figure out a work around.


Yep.  Looks like its a timing issue.  Tried changing the speed setting in the BIOS from AUTO to 1866 for the new DIMMs, but still does not boot with just  the new 1866 DIMMs in place.  Can't even get to the BIOS screen.  Putting the old 1333 DIMM in just causes an O/C failure.   So ended up reverting the BIOS to Auto speed selection and running with the new DIMMs plus one of the old 1333 modules.    Stumped to be honest, tho just noticed the new DIMMs are 1.5v but the old 1333 DIMM is 1.65v.




Turned pc on this morning and tried too games and they are both running ****** compared too last night, deep rock galactic i had locked too 120fps and hots 120fps and both would hardly dip, now I loaded up hots and im getting 80 ish and deep rock 50, what should I be looking at? GPU usuage says 100% cpu temps fine, used ddu and reinstalled drivers, dno what else too check,

Are you sure Windows isn't downloading an update in the background?


says up too date


Drivers drivers drivers. If you've already tried nvidias latest, try them again.



Then try older ones you had before.


Also try updating mobo drivers and check things on cpu z (eg ram hasn't defaulted to like 1333mhz stock or something silly


its the drivers for sure, I unistalled old installed new and everything was fine (first time changed nothing) started pc again this morning and once again games getting crap performance, I noticed that nvidia settings isnt saving max framerate either, I have used ddu 4 times now, now idea wtf is going on


Have a look in your windows update history. Is windows replacing with a generic driver? Auto update sometimes screws up


Also if you have any kind of auto update from nvidia id turn that off too. I never trust auto updates for this reason you're having




Hi All,



looking for some advice for a newbie pc gamer. I don't have a clue on hardware or what i need to spend. Do I build it myself or buy a OC pre-built machine? 



Any advice would be appreciated.


I'd suggest going pre build as its the only way to get a GPU right now without going through a lot of hassle with stock alerts or paying scalpers prices.



What games do you want to play? For eg the latest AAA titles etc. 



Do you already have a monitor or will you need to buy one? What resolution do you want to game at as this will effect how much GPU power you need and how much you need to spend.


I like to play MMO and AAA games. I have a monitor the LG27GN and would like to play in 1440p.


The ideal Gpus would range between a 3060ti and 3080 with pre builds from around 1.2k ~ 2.2k so really depends on what sort of budget you have at your disposal.


I am looking to spend about £1500 but would this be enough to get my a decent rig? I can push a couple hundred pounds extra if it’s helps.


This is a good pre built machine.

Similar to above but with a ryzen cpu which is a bit faster although not by much when gaming at 1440p but it would offer a better upgrade path in the future.

The first thing you should do is set a budget.  When comes to PC building there are only 3 things which are even modestly difficult:



1) Setting a budget

2) Part compatibility

3) Finding Deals



As such you should start this thread with (1) and work out how much money you have to spend.

Moving down, as others have said (2) can be dealt with by buying prebuilt PC's.  I recommend doing this then upgrading the PC later in its life, learning as you go.



Once you've decided how much you can afford we can give better advice here on the forum.


Thanks for the advice. Ok my budget is £1500 then like people mentioned I can upgrade as i go


LG's 27GN950 is 4K monitor.

27GL850 is 2560x1440 model.

Anyway also that requires such amount of GPU power in AAA games that about only way to get graphics card in reasonable time is getting OcUK to build PC for you.



Those premade configs just often aren't greatest, but you can ask them to built it from parts you choose and take good base parts to last and give upgradability in future.

For example PSUs are mostly Kolink cheapos.


Maybe have a look at something like:

https://www.overclockers.co.uk/ocuk-gaming-fsg-plus-1080p-1440p-pre-built-gaming-pc-fs-1d4-ep.html



The build from Joxeon if you want to try installing the OS (it doesn't come with Windows).



Or have a go with the Configurator (https://www.overclockers.co.uk/pc-systems/gaming-pc) and then post a link to the build you've put together.

We then can comment on your decisions.




Finally decided to ditch the sound bar that I've been using for the past year (Sony HT-S350), which isn't bad, but somehow lack as PC Speaker.



Started looking but really confused.

Pretty much set to get something from Edifier, or similar (won't even dream to get any Logitech, always got trouble after few months).



Not sure if the lack of a subwoofer on those 2.0 active speaker bundles is a worth compromise, or getting a more generic speaker layout (without dedicated tweeter / midrange), or going B-Grade which at least for speakers is a bit scary for me, as there's potential for some issue identified by the first buyer but that I may not be able to identify in time to sort out.



Basically I'm considering:

Edifier M3600D, roughly £160,

Edifier S350DB (B-Grade) £190 (really the max I'm willing to spend) or

Edifier STUDIO R1600T III £90.



Ideally the speaker will be connected straight to the motherboard.

No Bluetooth or other features necessary.

Any other options?


I’d consider studio monitors such As the Presonus Eris E5 too.



will be better dynamically than the Edifier



there’s smaller and cheaper options too such as the Eris E3.5


I'll give you my thoughts on this.



Studio monitors should be better then the Edifiers, you should find they have better tweeters, better quality amp.  However I have an issue with studio monitors being there not necessary the most relaxing to listen to.  One issue with studio monitors is there very honest, so you find yourself listening to say someone's You Tube channel and being more critical of their production (studio monitors highlight sound issues).



The other issue with studio monitors they need a good quality low noise source input, ideally XLR, you don't have any thing that can provide this.



Second issue with small speakers (including small studio monitors) is they don't provide the very low frequencies, about 45Hz is the lowest desk size speakers go, to get around this you need a sub to provide gentle fill in of those lower frequencies.



Of what you have listed I would choose the 2.1 Edifier S350DB, then I would connect the optical output from your motherboard to them.


Went with the Efifier S351DB. Still in the box, but will test during the week.

Almost 20kg for the set, I'm quite impressed 

The main point was to keep things simpler.

For car audio, as I've done many times, I wouldn't mind the whole thing, and the many hours setting everything out.

But for the PC, an amplified kit, with a (I believe) good quality, and 20% off, new (£192), was hard to pass.

Appreciate the suggestions.


The Efifier S351DB should be pretty good.    For best results you need to place the satellite speakers on stands and raise them up closer to ear level, search other posts on here about speaker stands.



Also, when you first use the speaker, don't drive them to hard, they need at least a couple of days of run in time.  Start playing them at lower volume then gradually build up, you will know they are run in when the bottom end sounds more rounded.




I’m wondering what kind of a PC it would take to run Assetto Corsa Competizione with a Reverb G2 in the highest possible settings and get a solid 90FPS whilst playing online with a grid of 20+ cars. 



I know this is probably almost impossible to answer but I want to know if it can be done and what this would cost? 



Anyone have a very high end system that can give me some details and figures from their own experience? 



If I can build or buy a PC that can do this I’m going all in as it’s pretty much my only hobby now and should last me a few years and get good use. 



I’m going to keep my current PC (6700K with 2070 Super) for ‘everything else’ so won’t be transferring anything across. 



Budget is £2500 for the tower only so I’m hoping I can do this.


I have a Reverb G2 on pre-order and still have not received it (what a mess ... ). I completed my PC build a week or so back. I eventually ended up with a 3090 FE and 5900x CPU (you should be aware that there are many reports of Reverb G2 having issues with AMD motherboards though especially the x570 ones ... check reddit). I think 3080 Ti (when it comes out) could also suffice, but will have to wait and see what the reviews are like. 10GB VRAM (3080 cards) may not be enough for max settings based on a number of VR related posts on Reddit. Also from the general reviews I have seen, the AMD GPUs perform worse than Nvidia 3000 series in 4k (for PC gaming 4k is not essential, but for VR it is a different story). Hope that helps.



Edit: Came to about £3k for the tower.


Many thanks for your reply, I wasn’t aware of the issues with the G2 and 5000 series, interesting.



I have been running the G2 with my 2070 Super in ACC and on low settings at 60hz I get a decent picture and about 60fps. That is in single player, online will make the FPS plummet. fps VR reports 7+GB of video ram in use so it looks like a 10GB card will not be enough.

Im going to wait for the 3080 ti and maybe the new Intel cpus before I decide so plenty of time to see what happens with everything hardware wise.


Hey,



Just back to see how your PC build is? Is it a good performer or would you now have changed anything?



I managed to buy a 3090 FE card which I now have and I’m now thinking of upgrading the rest of the system. I cannot decide between the 5900x or 10900K.


Hey, that's great!



My PC is working perfectly fine and works well with my G2 (received it mid Dec). Mind you 3090 + 5900x is top of the spec!! However:



1. My RAM is running @ 2100 Mhz rather than 3600 Mhz (that's what I paid for!!) as I need to update the BIOS of my MSI Unify x570 motherboard. The bios update is currently in Beta ... so I am waiting for the final release (without the Bios update, using XMP results in crash / reboot .... there is a fix though according to reddit, but requires manual workaround that I haven't had time to look into).



2. I am using an external powered USB hub ("Powered USB Hub RSHTECH 4 Port USB 3.0 Data hub", costs about £21.99) from day one of getting my G2 without any problems (I did not try any of my Motherboard's UBS ports due to problems others have faced .... I will avoid an Asus x570 motherboard as most of the reported G2 + x570 problems seem to be Asus related).
