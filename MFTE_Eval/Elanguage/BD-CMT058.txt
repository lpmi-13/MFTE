It is high time for BD to switch from big investments in coal powered energy (that is unsustainable) to big investments in solar energy. Solar is rapidly becoming the most economic form of energy (besides being the most sustainable already). It's a matter first of all of a choice (or a change) of energy investment policy of the country -- the investors in solar would follow in its wake.

Some historical observers assume that the Chinese silk production followed from its knowlege gained and imported into the country by the Chinese travelers and scholars, visiting and working in the great Budhist monasteries of Bengal in the 7th and 8th centuries.

A right first step towards stabilizing the paddy price to a fair level for the farmers.
Another major step is required. It is necessary now to intoduce workable agricultural insurence policy schemes for all agricultural producers of the country. This would protect the farmers and other agri-workers (and so also the food security of the country as a whole) against the vagaries of weather, price instability and increasingly frequent out of season floodings.

Eco friendly development projects are a good market to invest in. Many Western economies are integrated more eco friendly development.

Chinese financing for additional railway connection. What ever bridge to be sighted at least middle of 2018.


Was not the Padma bridge going to be finance by the Govt Of Bangladesh then why does the Bangladesh Govt need Chinese finance? So at last we need other country to finance the bridge.


The bridge itself is being financed by the government, the rail link on the other hand is likely going to be financed by the Chinese. It'd be stupid not to go for a loan if the interest is low anyways and just spend out of the treasury. in the case of a low interest loan, the bridge will essentially pay for itself as the tolls would cover the interest and the loan amount.

Subsidies are nice, but there needs to be a way for farmers to enable themselves (insurance, group investment and farming loans), Govt. does have the field force to organize farmers, provide support services (beyond the massive and great work that the government is already doing) and also increase farmer linkage to large scale buyers. Farmers might also get better prices if there were initiatives in agro processing and value added products.






Under what capacity is it aid, what is wrong with this writer, do you know what foreign aid is and foreign direct investment or a loan for that matter is? These are loans to be repaid back to lender with interest.

Thank you for the news. We, GPEU is eagerly waiting for the Registration Certificate from the Registrar of Trade Unions without any delay. We are very much respectful to the current government to ensure workers' rights as per their commitment. Hope we can build positive, ideal and better Industrial Relations among GPEU, GP and Government. We are very much confident to run a registered union in Bangladesh for the greater interest of the workers, GP and our country. We can contribute socio-economic development of Bangladesh. We will prove it  .

A national data center for storing public and private sector data should be built using totally national resources. Not to be sounding like a conspiracy theorists but let's face the reality, there's a digital cold war going on all over the world. Governments trying to snoop in on other governments' information and everything. China might be ally, but we certainly cannot hand the contract for the country's sole and concentrated data center in the hands of a Chinese company. Are our own IT, CSE, EEE and Civil engineers not capable enough of building the data center? Do we not have enough work force? Can our own military, who's salary and overall budget is about to get a substantial increase, come up with security measures?


This is just plain retarded ... not to mention extremely dangerous. The idea of citizens using a data bank managed by the state to store digital content, personal or otherwise is absurd! The constitution provides for the right to privacy to protect us from government intrusion... stop drowning the nation in debt and focus on other projects in need of desperate attention. Health care, education, housing, etc

"India has named eight border points to move its goods to and from Bangladesh ....., and demanded dedicated space for its goods at the ports.
In response, Dhaka said three border points could be allowed at most, and there will be no dedicated space for Indian goods at any of the ports."

It would be interesting to know if such words as "demanded" in the first sentence and "allowed" in the second sentence were actually said or used. If so, it would reflect a rather poor mode of discourse in international negotiations, or if not, a poor mode of reporting!
