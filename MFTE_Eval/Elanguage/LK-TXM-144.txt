28/08/2020, 10:15 - $A: He's a tech lead at 99x
28/08/2020, 10:18 - $M: $A Thanks man. Appreciate it I'll get in contact with him.
28/08/2020, 10:58 - $C: $M Don't know a lot about React, but from my experience with Angular:

Are you using a microfrontend to resolve a performance issue? Or something else?
28/08/2020, 10:59 - $C: If performance is the only concern, it might be worth looking into the options available in your bundler (Webpack, Rollup, or whatever you use)
28/08/2020, 11:00 - $C: And implementing lazy loading
28/08/2020, 11:01 - $C: Instead of splitting your app at the codebase level, do it at the build stage
28/08/2020, 11:02 - $A: I don't think that'd be a good idea if he's using create-react-app
28/08/2020, 11:02 - $A: You'll have to eject the app and do the configs yourself which might not be scalable
28/08/2020, 11:02 - $M: No we're trying to split our app up because the old team used a an older version of react for development and we're essentially creating the section as a brand new app
28/08/2020, 11:02 - $M: Yeah
28/08/2020, 11:02 - $C: If he's using that he will have Webpack
28/08/2020, 11:02 - $A: It's all under the hood and not accessible bro
28/08/2020, 11:02 - $P: Hi I'm the old team.
28/08/2020, 11:02 - $C: Yes, but you can eject
28/08/2020, 11:02 - $M: I can't access it cause it's inbuilt
28/08/2020, 11:03 - $A: That's just asking for troubleüòÖ
28/08/2020, 11:03 - $C: That's fair
28/08/2020, 11:03 - $M: We have to use react-rewired
28/08/2020, 11:03 - $M: Hello old team
28/08/2020, 11:03 - $C: Might not be worth the time
28/08/2020, 11:03 - $M: I'm new team
28/08/2020, 11:03 - $M: We're resorting to micro frontends but the way the old app is structured is making it near impossible for us to use it
28/08/2020, 11:04 - $M: But our leads are insistent that we stick to mf
28/08/2020, 11:04 - $C: So you're converting your entire structure to mfes?
28/08/2020, 11:04 - $C: Or just your new modules?
28/08/2020, 11:04 - $M: We're trying to without altering the original project
28/08/2020, 11:05 - $M: Without altering it too much at least
28/08/2020, 11:05 - $M: Because we're scared that if we moved something now it could break parts of the app
28/08/2020, 11:05 - $M: I would've preferred if we used code splitting and just developed it on the same app
28/08/2020, 11:05 - $C: That's a paradox ü§î
28/08/2020, 11:05 - $M: But that isn't an option rn
28/08/2020, 11:06 - $C: If you want an mfe you will have to cut and chop
28/08/2020, 11:06 - $A: How big of an app is this?
28/08/2020, 11:06 - $C: It's going to happen at some point, so make your peace with it
28/08/2020, 11:06 - $A: I'm getting shivers just thinking about it
28/08/2020, 11:06 - $C: Virtusa man
28/08/2020, 11:06 - $M: It's not too big just yet but it's already messy lol
28/08/2020, 11:07 - $C: I have been through the hell that is microfrontends
28/08/2020, 11:07 - $C: And converting big apps to and from a mfe
28/08/2020, 11:07 - $M: What a legend
28/08/2020, 11:07 - $C: With Angular though
28/08/2020, 11:07 - $A: Right?!üòÇ
28/08/2020, 11:07 - $M: üòÇ
28/08/2020, 11:08 - $C: It's a massive pain
28/08/2020, 11:08 - $C: Didn't work out in the end too üòÇ
28/08/2020, 11:08 - $M: Rubbing salt
28/08/2020, 11:08 - $C: They decided to go with lazy loading üòÇ
28/08/2020, 11:08 - $A: 
28/08/2020, 11:08 - $C: Which is kind of like code splitting I guess
28/08/2020, 11:08 - $M: Oh well üòÇ
28/08/2020, 11:08 - $M: I was thinking of just using iframes
28/08/2020, 11:09 - $M: Seems relatively simple to implement
28/08/2020, 11:09 - $A: Wtf eww
28/08/2020, 11:09 - $C: At the end the app had been taken apart and put together so many times it looked like Frankenstein
28/08/2020, 11:09 - $M: I'll hit you mannnn
28/08/2020, 11:09 - $C: Ah, yes
28/08/2020, 11:09 - $C: Enslaved 2007
28/08/2020, 11:09 - $M: Yesss
28/08/2020, 11:09 - $M: Old but gold
28/08/2020, 11:10 - $C: ...which is why I'm telling you
28/08/2020, 11:10 - $C: if you're going to start the mfe fire
28/08/2020, 11:10 - $A: I'm working on a bigass monolithic react app right now...hope to God they won't think of converting it into mfes
28/08/2020, 11:11 - $C: Make absolutely sure that you can handle the smoke
28/08/2020, 11:11 - $M: Technically what we have but smaller
28/08/2020, 11:12 - $C: This would be an option if your concern is performance
28/08/2020, 11:14 - $M: Sigh
28/08/2020, 11:14 - $M: Thanks anyway
30/08/2020, 23:04 - $I:

01/09/2020, 11:22 - $P: Idk if it going to be a good op or whether it will match the anime, but TXT is pretty good.
01/09/2020, 11:23 - $M: Oh. Well. I don't know how to react to this part. I just don't want no K-Pop music
