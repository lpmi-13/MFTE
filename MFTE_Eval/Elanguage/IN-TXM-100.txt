7/18/20, 9:35 PM - $A1: Mine remains same
7/18/20, 9:38 PM - $H: For now, *I think* we've been given marks for:
1. efhk and efh have been marked as right
2. 8 super keys ( any other answer has been marked as incorrect, if you answered 6 before and got marks, now marks will be deducted)
3. Lossy has been marked as correct
Ma'am hasn't confirmed anything as of yet about which questions she's changed the answers for. I'll let you know when she responds.
For the 3NF question, I will ask her about it, let's be patient.
7/18/20, 9:38 PM - $H: Probably because you got marks for one question and lost marks for another
7/18/20, 10:13 PM - $B1: My bad i didn't see my mark
