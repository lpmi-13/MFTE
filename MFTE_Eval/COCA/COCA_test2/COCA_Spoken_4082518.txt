##4082518 @!HARRY-SMITH-CBS-A : A day of rage : as Egyptians take to the streets , President Mubarak fires his cabinet but refuses to resign . Is one of Americas most important allies at a tipping point ? Im Harry Smith . Also tonight , the legacy of Challenger . @ ! UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Challenger , go with throttle up . @!SMITH : A quarter of a century after the disaster , a legacy of learning . And the American spirit . An amazing rise -- from defeat to cant be beat . @!ANNOUNCER : From CBS News world headquarters in New York , this is the CBS EVENING NEWS with Katie Couric. @!SMITH : Good evening , Katie is off tonight . Egypts president , Hosni Mubarak , is facing the most serious threat to his 30-year-old regime . For decades , anger has simmered near the surface in Egypt and throughout the Arab world , anger over corrupt governments , poverty , and a lack of freedom . Today , for the fourth straight day , protestors poured into the streets of Cairo and other cities in Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water cannon , rubber bullets and tear gas . President Mubarak imposed a curfew and cut off all Internet access . He also called out the military to restore order . Late tonight , Mubarak went on television and said he s firing his cabinet but he is staying put . This wave of protest began two weeks ago in Tunisia with the overthrow of the president . Today in Tunis , police again clashed with protestors who want the prime minister to resign as well . And thousands marched today in Jordan . They also want their prime minister to step down amid rising food prices and high unemployment . Tonight , though , the worlds attention is focused on Egypt , anxious to see if the Mubarak government can survive . Elizabeth Palmer reports from Cairo . @!ELIZABETH-PALMER- : By night fall , central Cairo looked like a war zone . Antigovernment protestors had fought their way past police and pushed into the very heart of the city cheering and chanting " We demand the end of the regime . " Hours earlier after Friday prayers , crowds set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of police in full riot gear who beat them and fired round after round of tear gas and rubber bullets . Thats the frontline right there . Thats where the police lines are preventing people from getting to the center of town . These demonstrators are penned in and furious . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : ( screaming ) @!PALMER : They want one thing . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : We do nt want this party anymore ! Go , leave out of Egypt ! @!PALMER : People are demanding an end to corruption , to abuse , unemployment . But above all they want to see the end of President Hosni Mubarak. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Go away of Egypt . Go away of Egypt ! @!PALMER : The main stand off played out on Qasr al-Nil Bridge over the Nile River . Protestors who funneled here from all parts of the city were determined to cross into downtown . A brave few rushed forward through the volleys of tear gas . The mass followed until they were pushed back again by the police . But the protestors refused to give up , at one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , skirmishes left the injured to be tended by the crowd . Theyre firing rubber bullets , says this demonstrator . And theyre firing them right in our faces . East of Cairo in the city of Suez , protestors attacked a police van . The driver was finally forced to escape by driving through the crowd . As dusk fell in Cairo , the crowds had grown so huge , pressing forward from the bridge , throwing rocks , until the police seemed simply to give up and the crowds streamed forward into Cairos Freedom Square . Nearby , a powerful symbol of Mubaraks regime , his political party headquarters , was looted and set ablaze . Authorities had announced curfew in cities across the country , but in Cairo , at least , nobody pays any attention . Then suddenly the army appeared and the protestors cheered , climbing on the military vehicles and welcoming the soldiers who appeared to be under orders to guard strategic public buildings . Finally , after midnight , President Hosni Mubarak appeared on television and told the country I will ask my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the current situation . @!PALMER : So President Hosni Mubarak made a concession there , but it certainly isnt the one the demonstrators were asking for . He s going to fire the cabinet , but he does remain president and the power is concentrated very much in his hands . Harry ? @!SMITH : So , Liz , even at this late hour , there are still people in the streets . What is the situation there now ? @!PALMER : Its still very unstable . You may be able to hear people shouting . It seems plausible that the news of the speech has made it into the crowds and its inflamed them . We can also see the police retaking territory they lost earlier in the day and I believe we were hearing live rounds , which we did nt hear earlier on . So it may be were seeing the beginning of a crackdown . But the demonstrators are nt giving up . @!SMITH : So we know that the government has shut off the Internet , shut off Twitter . But were people around Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their television sets ? @!PALMER : Astonishingly , Egyptian state television , which usually toes the party line , was showing pictures of what was going on here . And furthermore the Arab satellite channels have covered it like a blanket so anybody who has access to a television in Egypt knows exactly whats going on . @!SMITH : And , Liz , is there any way to guess what might unfold tomorrow ? @!PALMER : We are in completely uncharted waters here , Harry . Theres no question Egyptians will wake up tomorrow to a new chapter in their history . But whether it would be ugly or hopeful I do nt think anybody knows tonight . @!SMITH : Liz Palmer in Cairo this evening . Thank you very much . And just moments ago , President Obama made a statement about the turmoil in Egypt . @!BARACK-OBAMA-PRES : Our first concern is preventing injury or loss of life so I want to be very clear in calling upon the Egyptian authorities to refrain from any violence against peaceful protestors . The people of Egypt have rights that are universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!SMITH : The administration faces some very tough questions tonight , whom to support -- a trusted ally or the people in the street . Chip Reid is at the White House and has more tonight . Chip ? @!CHIP-REID-CBS-COR : Well , Harry , weve been waiting all day to hear from the president , we finally did . He s still walking that fine line , on the one hand condemning the Egyptian authorities for the violence and supporting the protestors but he s also reluctant to give up old American friend Hosni Mubarak. @!HILLARY-RODHAM-CLI : We are urging that there be a restraint on the part of the security forces . @!REID : In Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took the lead calling on the Egyptian government to stop the violence . While at the White House , Press Secretary Robert Gibbs voiced sympathy for the Egyptian people . @!ROBERT-GIBBS-WHIT : Their grievances have reached the boiling point . And they have to be addressed . @!REID : But the administration stopped short of explicit threats or angry denunciations of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. partner in the Arab world for 30 years . He s worked closely with Presidents Jimmy Carter , Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush , Bill Clinton , George W. Bush and now President Obama who , in 2009 , invited Mubarak to the Oval Office . @!OBAMA-AUGUST-18- : Im grateful to President Mubarak for his visit , for his willingness to work with us on these critical issues . @!REID : Issues ranging from Middle East peace to the war in Iraq to Irans nuclear weapons program . Despite that close relationship , the U.S. has little control over Mubaraks actions now . Today , using what leverage it has , the White House warned Egypt its considering cutting foreign aid . During the three decades of Mubaraks rule , Egypt has ranked second in U.S. aid , with a staggering $68 billion . Mubaraks survival is impossible to predict and , even if he does , his plan to make his son his heir apparent is now in serious jeopardy . That uncertainty has the White House walking a tight rope . @!JUAN-ZARATE-CBS-N : Clearly weve got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we espouse and supporting countries and allies that have been long-standing friends to the United States . @!EDWARD- " NED " -WALKE : He has had a blank check and somebody has to wake him up . @!REID : But former U.S. ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker says its time to the Obama administration to side more forcefully with the Egyptian people , even if that means abandoning their long-time ally . @!WALKER : We do nt need Mubarak , we need Egypt . Egypt is very important to us . But Mubarak is not Egypt . @!REID : And making clear how little control the United States has of this situation , the president said in the end the future of Egypt is in the hands of the Egyptian people . Harry ? @!SMITH : Chip Reid at the White House tonight . Thank you . Richard Haass is president of the Council on Foreign Relations . He is at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland . Richard , the United States government has been such a good friend to Hosni Mubarak for a long time , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the streets , in Cairo and the other cities in Egypt . It really leaves the United States in a quite precarious position . @!RICHARD-HAASS-PRE : Youre right , it is precarious , but the United States has to be very careful . The stakes here are enormous , Harry , Egypt is somewhere between one-fourth and one- third of the entire Arab world . If instability comes to Egypt , it will send shockwaves throughout the rest of the Arab world . Its the first country to establish peace with Israel . Its , indeed , the cornerstone of what peace there is in the Middle East . So if the United States is seen to pull the rug out from under this friend which , as you noted in the report , a friend for some three decades , it will raise major questions about American reliability . On the other hand , if were seen to give him an uncritical embrace , it could risk alienating the Egyptian people and some future government we may have to work with . @!SMITH : Weve seen this go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were protests in Yemen yesterday . What is going on here ? @!HAASS : Well , what were seeing is a part of the world that has largely missed out on many of the great trends of modern decades . There really has nt been anything like the political and economic reform in the Middle East that weve seen in Europe , in Asia , and Latin America and Africa . And suddenly its coming and its coming suddenly . In part triggered by the Tunisian experience and the social media . But the Middle East -- the Middle East was ripe for this kind of change . The kindling , if you will , is extraordinarily dry here and thats what were seeing not just in Egypt but also in several other countries . @!SMITH : And how much should we be concerned about what a new Egypt might look like ? @!HAASS : Well , we should be very concerned . The last thing we want to have , say , is an Egypt in chaos or an Egypt dominated by Islamic fundamentalists . We do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States has to be very careful in how it manages this situation . And if the government survives -- and we should take our cue from the army here -- if the government survives , then we should try to work out a long- term reform program . If , however , the government cant survive -- and , again , the army will tell us this , perhaps as early as tomorrow , Harry -- then we have to start working on the - on plan B , on putting into place some alternative . The one thing we never want to have in Egypt is the sort of thing , say , we had in Iran three decades ago where the choice is between an authoritarian government and a radical Islamist alternative . So we either want to push the Mubarak government in the direction of reform or , if its too late for that , we want to work with some successor government . @!SMITH : Richard Haass in Davos tonight , thank you very much for your expertise . I do appreciate it , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nelson Mandela ease somewhat when he was discharged after two days in the hospital . The 92- year-old former president was taken by ambulance to his home in suburban Johannesburg . He will continue treatment there for what doctors call an acute respiratory infection . They say his condition is now stable . Still ahead on the CBS EVENING NEWS , " The American Spirit . " The comeback kids reaching new heights . But up next , 25 years later , the Challenger crew inspires a new generation of explorers . @!COURIC : 25 years ago today , the nation watched in horror as the space shuttle Challenger blew apart just after liftoff . Today at the Kennedy Space Center , family and friends and coworkers gathered to remember the crew and its legacy . As Kelly Cobiella reports , the Challenger seven are still an inspiration . @!KELLY-COBIELLA-CB : It was a bright , cold morning and the nations eyes were on Florida . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Pilot Mike Smith followed by Christa McAuliffe. @!COBIELLA : NASA was about to send a seven-person crew into space , among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt think any teacher has ever been more ready . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : I always wanted to be an astronaut. @!COBIELLA : Sheree Kearns was working at an accountants office . @!SHEREE-KEARNS : Part of my spirit was really with these teams when they went up and when I saw the vehicle lifted off , my heart was just rising up . This is the teacher going . This is awesome . @!COBIELLA : 73 seconds into flight , it was suddenly , horrifically , over . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Obviously a major malfunction. @!COBIELLA : And school kids across the country saw it . Matt Hagopian was in eighth grade . @!MATT-HAGOPIAN : You could just tell that it did nt go as planned and it was just gone from , like , confusion to just , like , shock . @!KEARNS : If your heart could sink to your stomach , I think thats what I felt . @!COBIELLA : NASA took the blame for putting an ambitious launch schedule ahead of safety . For two years , the shuttle program was grounded , but in that time , another mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the helm. @!JUNE-SCOBEE-RODGER : The world knew how they died . We want the world to know how they lived so why not build a tribute to them ? @!COBIELLA : Millions of people remember watching the shuttle explode live on television . But the crews families wanted their memories to live on in a different way , so they created this , a place where kids can explore space and be inspired . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Look at the radar screen . @!COBIELLA : Its the Challenger Learning Center . An interactive space lab where kids can try out all things space and even be part of the crew . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Little kids will come up the to me when Im wearing my flight suit and theyll say are you an astronaut ? No , but I do aspire to be one . @!HAGOPIAN : Today is the 25th anniversary of ... @!COBIELLA : Matt Hagopian ... @!HAGOPIAN : I was exactly your age . I was in eighth grade . @!COBIELLA : ... was inspired to become an eighth grade science teacher . @!KEARNS : Ladies and gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!COBIELLA : And Sheree Kearns left the accountants office to become the fictional Commander Kearns at the Challenger Center in Jacksonville . @!KEARNS : Maybe this is where I need to be to inspire that next person who goes and walks on Mars and maybe theyll call me back one day and say Commander Kearns , remember me ? @!COBIELLA : 4 million kids have now gone through those centers and the 48th center opened today , numbers theyre very proud of here at Kennedy Space Center . Harry ? @!SMITH : Kelly Cobiella at the Kennedy Space Center tonight . Thank you . Coming up next , a deadly gun battle right inside a police station . @!SMITH : The crisis in the Middle East hit the financial markets hard . The Dow plunged 166 points , the biggest one-day loss in nearly six months . As it often does in times of turmoil , the price of oil rose up $3.70 a barrel . And as investors look for a safe haven , the price of gold shot up $22 an ounce . A hostage drama unfolded today in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun emerged from a bank in Tacoma Park , Maryland . He was using a woman as a shield from police whod taken up positions in the parking lot . As the officers held their fire , a dye pack exploded in a bag holding the gunmans loot , releasing a cloud of red smoke . Then , trying to back away from the police , he slipped and fell losing his hold on the hostage . She ran for it and as he pursued her the police opened fire . The gunman was hit and later died . Now to an even more shocking video released today . Security camera video of a wild shootout last Sunday inside a Detroit police station . The gunman took a shotgun into a precinct headquarters in northwest Detroit and started shooting . The shooter , 38-year-old Lamar Moore , was being investigated for a sexual attack on a 13-year-old girl . He fired his pistol-grip shotgun again and again as wounded police officers scrambled for cover and others returned fire . At one point , split-screen video showed Moore scrambling over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic point in the shootout , an officer faced Moore with his gun drawn only to be downed by a 20-gauge shotgun blast at point-blank range . The gunfire went on until at last Moore died in a hail of police bullets . Amazingly , no officers were killed . Four were wounded but all are expected to recover . Well be right back . @!SMITH : Everyone loves a comeback story and this one is pretty amazing . A basketball team that just three years ago lost a game by 75 points is now ranked 20th in its division and has nt lost a game . Along the way , Wyatt Andrews reports the players overcame some significant obstacles with the American spirit . @!WYATT-ANDREWS-CBS : With his team trailing and time running out last Sunday , Gallaudet coach Kevin Cook did nt think his players would win . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : We fine . We know what were doing . @!ANDREWS : He knew they would . Gallaudet did win 51-48 to stay undefeated at 16 and 0 . Its remarkable when every member on this team is either deaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All he sees are tough athletes who have willed themselves to win . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : M , T , X , E. @!ANDREWS-@1on-camer : MTXE ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Mental toughness , extra effort . When we face any adversity , they just find a way . @!ANDREWS-@1voice-ov : And by the way , coach Cook himself is battling Parkinsons disease . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : You know , its stressful time it will really be like this . @!ANDREWS : Which means that when the tension is highest , Cooks shaking left hand stops him from calling plays in sign language . His assistants do to that for him . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALES : Three ! Three ! @!ANDREWS : The delay , he says , cost his team some six points a game but to the players its just another obstacle to knock down . @!NUKEITRA-HAYES-GA : It does nt -- it does nt bother us at all . He s just a coach that knows his stuff and we respect that . @!ANDREWS : If you think its a disadvantage when the entire team cant hear the coach change a play or hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They enjoy being underestimated . @!EASTER-FAAFITI-GA : Sometimes I get really upset . You know what ? I do nt need to talk to you , Ill just show you on the basketball floor . @!COOK : I tell our group , you know , yes , its not fair . Its not fair that youre deaf . Its not fair that youre hard of hearing . I do nt think its fair that I have Parkinsons but this is life , guys , and were going to fight everything - and were going to fight everything together . @!ANDREWS : And now they have fought to 16-0. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Yes , coach ! @!ANDREWS : The coach that cant stop shaking and a team that cant hear are unbeaten on the court by any other team . @!COOK : One , two , three ! @!ANDREWS : But theyre unbeaten in life by choice . Wyatt Andrews , CBS News , Washington . @!SMITH : Katie will be back on Monday . Im Harry Smith . Good night .
