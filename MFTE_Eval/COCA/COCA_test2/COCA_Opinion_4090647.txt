##4090647 California is not Wisconsin , but the same forces at work there are trying to deprive workers here of their rights to bargain collectively " Unions take fight to more states , " Feb. 23. # Therefore , a gentle reminder : The classic divide-and-conquer strategy is still very much with us and being employed by politicians attempting to destroy labor unions at the behest of their corporate bosses . Pitting public employees against those in the private sector is designed to defeat collective bargaining rights for both . What all employees deserve will not be achieved by taking away the benefits public employees now have , but by giving those same benefits to everyone . Workers in the world 's other developed countries already have these rights . Look at Europe and then ask yourselves why Americans ca n't have what they do . # When 80 percent of the American people control less than 10 percent of our nation 's wealth , true democracy is no longer possible . Corporations already possess most of the power in our government . Let 's not give them full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , we must fight together against them to gain the rights all of us deserve under a truly democratic form of government . # # Re : your editorial " Mad in Madison " Feb. 22 . How dare you compare Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker to the ruthless , murderous Arab dictators ? # How double dare you compare the self-serving public employee protesters to the long-suffering , oppressed people of the Middle East ? # Oh , sure , now the desperate public employee unions claim they are willing to consider the economic concessions . But what no one realizes or is not willing to acknowledge is the equally onerous and costly work rules repeatedly surrendered through collective bargaining by indebted Democrat lawmakers . You honor the Democratic legislators for going into hiding to deny the Republicans the quorum they need " to ram through " their reforms . The Republican minority in Congress did not skip town to prevent the Dems from ramming through Obamacare. # # The Republicans are increasingly saying that public employees have employee benefits those in the private sector do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on public employees whose unions have managed to hang on to what corporate America has slowly taken away from the private sector is the wrong strategy . Instead , private-sector workers should be their health and retirement benefits be restored to 1980 levels . # Corporate America 's greed and relentless quest for profits at the expense of those who generate them is responsible for creating an underclass , not public employee unions . # # Blame the big banks . Blame the Wall Street meltdown . But do n't blame the public employee unions , not for this recession . # Is n't this recession happening in every state ? If unions are at fault , then why do states with no public employee unions have some of the worst budget messes ? State budgets are being stressed by public-employee pensions , but that did n't cause the recession . # Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker is using the crisis to get what he really wants , like weakening unions . If public employee unions go down , the rights of every working American go down with them . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to bargain collectively be taken from most state and local workers except the fire and police . Those two are the same unions that supported Walker in the last election . # Be ready : It happen here # The collapse of many buildings in the New Zealand earthquake should serve as a reminder : # When the next strong quake hits San Francisco , hundreds of " soft story " buildings will collapse . # People will die . # This scenario is entirely avoidable if building owners reinforce the structures they own . # If they ca n't afford to do so , they should sell to someone who can . # If they fail to make their buildings safe and people are killed in them , they should face criminal charges and go to jail . # Let 's fix our at-risk buildings now . # # In 1986 , President Ronald Reagan famously called him " this mad dog of the Middle East " shortly before bombing his barracks in a raid that narrowly missed Moammar Khadafy , killing his 15-month-old adopted daughter , Hanna . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West have repeatedly issued condemnations of Khadafy for a variety of terrorist plots and action , including the infamous Lockerbie bombing . # Today he is once again in the news , this time committing terrorism against his own citizens who are protesting peacefully against his 42-year iron-fisted rule . # His mercenaries have been shooting civilians from the ground , and his pilots have been attacking protesters from the air , resulting in hundreds of dead and wounded . # Libya 's ambassador to the United States on Monday joined other Libyan diplomats in calling for Khadafy to step down " Military attacks protesters with live fire in Tripoli , " Feb. 22 and asked the international community to strongly condemn the regime 's violent crackdown on protesters . # Yet for the first time in his history , the condemnations have been slow to come , and the silence from the White House has been deafening . # # Having read Ronnie Lovier 's article on the " Troubling absence of Al Jazeera in U.S. " Insight , Feb. 20 , I would point out that Al Jazeera English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a splendid addition to Roku 's offerings . # # Setting aside your disregard for the California Teachers Association , I direct these comments to your editorial pertaining to the " parent trigger " law " Politics gets in the way of strong school reform , " Insight , Feb. 20 giving parents a voice in their children 's education . # I commend those parents at McKinley Elementary School in Compton Los Angeles County who are voicing their concerns in a court of law against the state superintendent of education and the state school board . Though I am not privy to the complaints of these deeply concerned , responsible parents , I 'm certain that every one of them diligently does the following for their children : 1 oversees homework , 2 insists on a good night 's sleep , 3 feeds them a nutritional breakfast , 4 gets them to school on time , 5 monitors their health needs , and most important , 6 is a model for discipline and respect for themselves and others . # Oh , if this were always the norm . @ @ @
