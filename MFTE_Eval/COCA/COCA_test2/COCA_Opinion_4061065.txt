##4061065 President Obama pushes through the most gargantuan government spending program in history . Our children and grandchildren will be paying for countless years . It contains so much pork and tax increases , and it effectively ended any chances of a fair or realistic bipartisan vote . Now Obama boasts he will cut the federal deficit in half by the end of his term . With what ? You ca n't save what you 've already tossed to the wind . He needs to put out the fire , not stoke it with more tinder . <p> KEN HODGES <p> Saratoga <p> It is with regret that I draw your attention to Aaron Heller 's article in The Chronicle titled " Murals from Nazi Poland see the light " Feb. 23 . The title 's reference to " Nazi Poland " is a shocking distortion of historical fact . This is not merely a semantic matter . <p> There was never a " Nazi Poland . " The title illustrates an unacceptable distortion of Poland 's recent and tragic history . It also distorts the cruel terror that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its citizens of which 6 million , 3 million of whom were Jews , perished during World War II . Poland was an ally of Nazi Germany and had any collaborative regime . Between 1939 and 1945 , it was Poland that was occupied by Nazi Germany . Poland never capitulated as a state to the German Third Reich . I am sure that in addition to Poles and thousands of Polish American Californians who are your daily readers , others would also be indignant about the title used in the article . <p> ROBERT KUPIECKI <p> Ambassador <p> Republic of Poland <p> The forecast demise of the San Francisco Chronicle is an opportunity to finally have a world-class newspaper serve the Bay Area : The Northern California edition of the Los Angeles Times . <p> MICHAEL BURCH <p> La Caada Flintridge Los Angeles County <p> OK , I 'll admit I made some cranky remarks when I first saw the latest redesign we 've been thru a few , The Chron and I , but I have to say it did n't take me long to get used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now all together . <p> I cut my teeth on The Chron , reading Herb and Dear Abby , and have enjoyed it daily for more decades than I care to reveal . Now it seems that to quibble about the redesign is like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic . It 's there in the morning with my coffee and in the evening when I settle into the puzzle page . If The Chron sinks , then I might have to talk to my husband in the morning and read a book at night . The horror ! <p> KAREN HOOPER <p> Mill Valley <p> California 's dysfunctional governance process was all too evident in its latest and worst budget crisis . Our state is too large , diverse and important to try to continue to limp along with this outmoded structure . The Bay Area Council , the League of Women Voters , Common Cause and others are calling for a state constitutional convention . Sounds like an idea whose time has come . <p> WARD BELDING <p> Pleasanton <p> We are disappointed that The Chronicle singled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's severance program , in which 154 university employees participated . The program provided compensation based on a formula considering years of service and salary . Created to reduce the size of the office , the guidelines stated that eligible participants could locate another job in the UC system and still be paid . Williams , along with 15 other employees , followed these guidelines . <p> If The Chronicle finds fault with the severance program , then it has a problem with the program , rather than an individual . We find it unethical to debase Williams character and integrity because she participated in a cost-saving measure created by the office . She has devoted 21 years to UC as a leader , mentor and community partner and I commend her work toward the advancement of women and promoting diversity . <p> AMY LEVINE <p> San Francisco <p> With the Republicans voting in lockstep against both the president 's stimulus bill and the governor 's state budget , I am reminded of Gilbert and Sullivan 's witless Lord of the Admiralty , who boasted that " I always voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking for myself at all . " To press the point , the GOP is going to exact political revenge on the handful of its members who had the audacity to break ranks and think of the best interests of the people . <p> At a time when economic conditions are so unusually dire that there is not enough revenue to maintain minimal services for the indigent and disadvantaged and basic educational necessities for the nation 's young , it is absurd to reject any need to raise taxes and advocate that old discredited theory of trickle-down economics , first applied by Marie Antoinette , then President Ronald Regan . <p> PETER T. KIRWAN <p> Pebble Beach <p> Anyone who does not recognize the power , brilliance , relevance and significance of President Obama ' s address to Congress is not in full possession of his faculties . <p> Contrariwise , the response by Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal was typical Republican doubletalk . Most striking were Jindal 's remarks about the inadequacy of our response to Hurricane Katrina . In referring to the bureaucratic bungling at that crucial moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George W. Bush 's tenure . <p> ROBERT J. KAUFMANN <p> San Francisco <p> I rarely agree with Supervisor Chris Daly , but I have agreed with him for a long time that Market Street should be for transit and bicycles only . However , our agreement stops at his Transit First policy , which he translates as Transit Only , instead of the significantly better Transit First , which allows for automobiles to have some consideration in the planning . <p> I believe that if Market Street is Transit Only , then Mission Street should be for automobiles only , thus preserving some ability for us drivers to go downtown - which I do increasingly less often these days , because of the congestion . That is a good compromise . <p> EDWARD LORTZ <p> San Francisco <p> I 'm flabbergasted that the San Francisco Board of Supervisors can even consider funding a study to make Market Street car-free at a time when the city is in such financial crisis . City services are being gutted , workers are being laid off , health and human services are being drastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How many social workers and nurses , police and firefighters could be paid with the money being allocated for that study ? How many buses could be repaired , how many potholes could be fixed ? I spent more than 30 years spendthrifts known as the Board of Supervisors ? <p> RON BAUMHOVER <p> Concord <p>
