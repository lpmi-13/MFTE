##4062489 This weekend 's deadly shootings in Oakland and the previous shooting of Oscar Grant left many of us to question the state of our city . <p> Our community needs to look inward . Kids need to stay in school ; a ninth-grade education is sorely inadequate to survive today . We must address the issue of mutual respect between police and the community , and we must look at our values . Not until we value education over entertainers , life over Lexus and respect over reproach will we see an end to these types of tragedies . <p> WENDY WINTER Oakland <p> It 's long past time for responsible citizens to channel the grief and outrage over another tragic trail of multiple murders perpetrated by a violent criminal let free on parole to run amok , spreading death , destruction and mayhem . <p> PETER TAUSSIG Berkeley <p> Four Oakland police officers are dead . They were just men doing their jobs - trying to help make Oakland a better , safer place to live . <p> But in his reckless , self-centered and hateful mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men . It was n't an accident ; he had n't meant to pull his toothbrush and mistakenly grabbed his gun . He intentionally killed these men to avoid going back to prison for violating his parole . <p> So where 's the outrage , Oakland ? Is the " community " going to riot in the streets , break windows and burn cars over this ? No . They only do that when it suits them . Besides , they were just cops , right ? <p> MIKE PARDEE Oakland <p> Is there anyone too dim to see how assault weapons made this weekend 's Oakland police officers deaths more efficient ? <p> This is no different than Mexican police suffering grievously from being outgunned by drug gangs , who use assault weapons purchased and imported from American gun shows . <p> Pro-gun ideologues casually continue to ignore this reality , but again this week they have yet more police blood on their hands . <p> We should all join America 's police officers in condemning the gun-show and assault-weapons loopholes , and helping to reverse Alice-in-Wonderland policies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MURPHY <p> Mountain View <p> Want to know who is responsible for the endlessly repeated tragedies ? We are ... you and me and everyone else , excepting only anyone who knows and calls to account those who exercise authority to parole convicted criminals . <p> The fact is that those authorities are anonymous . Few of us ever question the system that permits the parole system to function in obscurity . The media ignores the issue and thus facilitates the in camera nature of what obviously is a dangerously malfunctioning system . <p> We should insist on the parole authorities identities being made known to the public and whenever a paroled violent criminal harms someone again , the authorities should be required to publicly explain why the repeat offender was freed before serving his full sentence . <p> PETER TAUSSIG Berkeley <p> How long did it take the parolee who murdered four Oakland police officers to arm himself after he was released ? Hours , days , weeks ? <p> This next week we are going to see hand-wringing , crocodile tears , meetings and lowering of flags to half-staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles , letters and editorials full of impotent outrage and silly accusations Attorney General Jerry Brown has already blamed the corrections department for releasing the killer . <p> Let Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger and our legislators do something besides spray us with words . Let them attend the funerals of every one of their constituents murdered by a handgun or other illegal weapon . Let our politicians return to their districts for every funeral , every day , every time someone is gunned down . <p> Let our legislators see up close the deadly results of their bipartisan refusal to enact an effective gun control law to protect us . <p> TOM PECK <p> San Francisco <p> Saturday 's shooting of four Oakland police officers was n't just a tragedy , it was an inevitability . There are really only two questions that need to be asked : How did a convinced felon get hold of multiple guns ? How quickly will the Second Amendment flag wavers chalk this incident up to inner-city lifestyle , instead of looking at the free flow of guns in this country ? There may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the right laws or not enough enforcement . <p> And speaking of enforcement , good luck to Oakland 's efforts to recruit new officers to its force . <p> DAVID SCHWARTZ <p> Oakland <p> A veteran journalist friend at The Chronicle numbly replied to my " How are you ? " with a sense of fear , drowning in the emotional swirl of her career possibly down the drain of despair as The Chronicle moves more precariously toward a possible shutdown . <p> I purchase a Chronicle every day from the rack for my commute , to support the paper and friends employed there . She replied the problem is n't with people not buying the paper , it 's the businesses who are n't advertising that affects the paper 's survival . I mentioned I shop businesses who advertise things I want , and recently discovered an Alameda shoe store which advertised exactly the shoes I needed in their Chronicle ad ; I 've also found several experienced home renovation companies advertising in The Chronicle . <p> Tell advertisers when you shop them that you saw their Chronicle ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do n't know about your business , how will they find you ? It is these advertisers , and those of us who shop them , who are helping to save the careers of dedicated , experienced journalists , not just those of us who are buying or subscribing to the paper . <p> K.C. FROGGE <p> Oakland <p> As a recently laid-off person , I can not afford the $16 increase for eight weeks . I love this paper and have for 29 years , but feel that going from $38 to $46 last summer , to $62 in 2009 is just too much ! Please figure out another way to save this paper . Do n't chase away your loyal subscribers who ca n't afford these increases . <p> LINDA FEDAK <p> San Leandro <p> We absolutely must have The Chronicle to provide us with vital news of the Bay Area as reported by journalists who know this region . Make it a regional newspaper with coverage from the Peninsula to the East Bay to the North Bay . Our local suburban newspapers ca n't do the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news that has a direct impact on our region . For other national and international news , The Chronicle can and should rely on the wire services . Thus , other than Sacramento and Washington , DC bureaus , The Chronicle could cut costs by relying on the wire services . <p> As for raising income , let The Chronicle promote classified advertisements on its Web site . Until I checked , I did not know that the SF Gate Web site had classified advertising . So , why does n't The Chronicle promote those classified advertisements as a major source of income ? <p> So for this vital newspaper to survive . <p> WES STARRATT <p> San Rafael <p>
