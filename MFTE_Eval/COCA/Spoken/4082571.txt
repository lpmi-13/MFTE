##4082571 You 're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY , from NPR . I 'm Ira Flatow . When you turn on a light or you power up your radio , where does the electricity come from ? Well , there 's a good chance it 's not coming from whatever power plant that 's actually closest to your electric outlet , but probably produced somewhere else and distributed over a complicated network to get to you - the famous electric grid , even though there are really many loosely interconnected grids . And the only time you really hear about the grid is - what ? What ? Summertime , when it fails ? There 's a brownout , a blackout , or now we talk about security concerns to the grid . And , of course , the grid is not getting any younger , and we 're placing more demands on the grid as we need more electricity for things we never had before . You can name them : computers , air conditioners , even the coming generations of plug-in cars . They 're all going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the journal IEEE Spectrum says that our national power grid has been getting less reliable over the years , even as we 're going to have to depend more on it . And next week , a major conference on smart grid technology kicks off to talk about engineering a new smart grid that perhaps may even heal itself . It can heal itself before it even breaks down . Joining me now to talk more about it is S. Massoud Amin . He is the director of the Technological Leadership Institute at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis . He holds the Honeywell/H.W . Sweatt Chair in Technological Leadership and professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering there . Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY . Professor S. MASSOUD AMIN ( Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , University of Minnesota ) : Thank you , Mr. Flatow. @!FLATOW : Please , do n't ... @(Soundbite-of-laugh) @!FLATOW : ... get so formal . What do you mean when you say that the system is getting less reliable ? How do you put that into numbers ? @!Prof-AMIN : When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two parts . One is the diminished shock absorbers in the system , in the high-voltage grid , as well as the innovation that goes into it . So when we look at the infrastructure , the depreciation amortization curve had crossed over investment in the infrastructure in 1995 . So we are overharvesting the existing assets , the existing infrastructure . And my hat is off to the grid operators across the nation and across North America that keep the lights on while operating a system that has less and less shock absorbers. @!FLATOW : If the shock absorbers , if they were on your car , you 'd know about it . But if - I guess , you know about it on the grid because we 're seeing more brownouts and blackouts than we used to ? @!Prof-AMIN : Yes , Ira . In - on average , actually , when we remove all the natural-caused ice storms , hurricanes , weather disasters from the outages , the most reliable part of our grid is - I 'm very fortunate I live in Minneapolis - is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per customer , per year . The worst part , the most vulnerable part - because of aging infrastructure - is New York and PGN , that gets about 240 minutes of outages per customer , per year . And on any given day , there are about half a million of our citizens without electricity for two or more hours per day . This is in contrast to , for example , Japan , that in Japan , using the same metric of removing natural-caused disturbances on outages , extreme events , customers experience four minutes of outage per customer , per year . @!FLATOW : So what are they doing better than us ? @!Prof-AMIN : We take our infrastructure for granted . To share with you a little bit on the investment - I 'm not even talking making it smarter . I 'm talking about just investment in keeping it strong and robust - a nation such as -emerging economies such as New Zealand , but established economies like England , Denmark , Spain , Netherlands , Norway , Poland , they invest between $12 million per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kV and higher , and this is normal , as put on the same level playing field . To give an example , England spent 16-and-a-half-million dollars per gigawatt , per year on their high-voltage transmission . All nations that had either partially deregulated or fully deregulated their system , they spend upwards of - at least Finland spends about seven million . It 's the lowest one . We are below that . @!FLATOW : We 're below that ? @!Prof-AMIN : We spend 4.6 million per - million dollars per gigawatt , per year on our super high-voltage , 230 kV and higher . In addition , they have a number of transmission-owning entities in - and those nations , all of them have one - New Zealand , England , Spain , Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Finland . Denmark has two . We have over 450 . And by saying that , whenever I present this , our colleagues ask , so should we nationalize the grid ? I said no , that is not our way of life in America . Instead , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of infrastructure is privately owned . We need to build incentives for the different stakeholders to upgrade the system , to look at it as a system , as almost - at least major interconnections . And hopefully , as they plan for the rest of this century , as a continental scale system , to bring again - to be able to bring where(ph) energy sources are and use the most efficient carrier of energy , which is electrons , to bring those resources to where the demand for electricity , demand for energies . @!FLATOW : Are you saying we do n't need a smart grid then or ... @!Prof-AMIN : No . Smart grid would make - is an overlay . So allow me to briefly say what smart grid is . Smart grid is the overlay , is the sensor network , communication overlay and control devices on top of that system . So there is a part - would you please - to use an analogy . Think about skeleton . @!FLATOW : Right . @!Prof-AMIN : Think about the musculature . And think about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grid is the enhancement to the sensors , communication , controls and devices and systems that operate as an overlay in parallel on top of this hardwired system to enhance reliability , minimize cost , reduce cost , improve security and resilience , robustness of the system . @!FLATOW : It 's almost like electronic or an autopilot , I imagine , on airplane . You 're not changing the wings and things , but you 're putting a smarter way to control the flight , because , as you say , those folks on the levers just ca n't keep up anymore , pushing those levers in those power plants and switching stations around the country . @!Prof-AMIN : I ( unintelligible ) actually , the genesis of this , when I had the privilege leading R&amp;D , beginning about 13 years ago at the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto , as the head of mathematics and information sciences there , that 's what I did . I used what I have learned , working for my McDonnell Douglas , Boeing Phantom Work , and NASA Ames , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect example is an F-15 pilot - that an Israeli pilot , Captain Zivi , had landed in 1983 with a missing wing . So this is enhanced avionics that are situational awareness , fastest situational awareness , to enable better control , better ... @!FLATOW : Mm-hmm . @!Prof-AMIN : ... security and resilience to unforeseen events . @!FLATOW : Do we need to engineer anything new or do - you know , what kind of engineering applications are required ? Or do we have what we need and it 's just not been put into play ? @!Prof-AMIN : There are both , a lot of it . Actually , many colleagues or many listeners probably are familiar with the smart meter . They think if I have a smart meter , I have a smart grid . But if you step a little bit out , get a bird 's eye view , you 're actually talking about end to end , from fuel source to the end use , from fuel source to the - to your device at home , at work . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurement node , on the customer citizens interface to the utility . So many of the communication , whether the backbone for the communication is fiber optic or microwave or local even - there is Wi-Fi , WiMAX security built-in - there has to be , security ... @!FLATOW : Right . @!Prof-AMIN : ... has to be a critical part of this so that it enhances security . It should be built-in as a design criteria , not sprinkled on as a condiment or glued on as a afterthought . @!FLATOW : But how do you get this done ? I mean , it - this is going to cost a lot of money . And we hear about the budgetary problems we 're having here . @!Prof-AMIN : Its bill(ph) - I will share with you the numbers . Currently , our outages in the United States costs our economy anywhere , depending on the year , anywhere from $80 billion a year to over $180 billion a year , outages , power quality disruptions . The more digital devices we are using , the more demand you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of doing the smart grid ? First , the cost of strengthening the backbone of the grid would costs us - and Department of Energy ( unintelligible ) have done the studies as part of transmission study - would costs us about $82 billion to make it stronger , if you will ... @!FLATOW : That 's one year 's worth of waste ... @!Prof-AMIN : Exactly . @!FLATOW : Yeah . @!Prof-AMIN : And this could be spread over 10 years . But it needs that kind of commitment , the 10-year commitment , eight billion a year , to retrofit and expand this among different stakeholders . So that 's stronger . Smarter , to make the overlay . Put the overlay of sensors , communication and control devices would cost us between 165 billion to $170 billion over 10 to 20 years , depending on what time horizon we put in . And the benefits of that , it would reduce outages by $49 billion a year . It would increase efficiency of the grid by over 4.5 percent as according to Pacific Northeast National Labs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency - improved efficiency . In addition , it would reduce emissions 12 to 18 percent . @!FLATOW : Wow . So who do you have to convince ... @!Prof-AMIN : You know , it is a clarity using science , using evidence , using engineering , to assess these and put all - everything on the canvas , everything , what works , what does n't work . @!FLATOW : Mm-hmm . So it 's up to someone to take an objective , critical look at this and say , you know , this makes sense . We should - it 's worth spending the money on , is what you 're saying . @!Prof-AMIN : That 's precisely what I 've had the privilege of doing for the last 14 years in this area . And the conclusions that I shared with you is a widespread assessment from every department of energy , national labs , even ( unintelligible ) group that looked at the entire end-to-end system modernization , complete revamp of the entire system . The current system in America , if you do n't think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North American . The U.S. portion is valued , the whole infrastructure , at about $1 trillion . And this $1 trillion system underpins our $14 trillion economy . @!FLATOW : All right . Well - and you 're going to be having a conference . The IEEE is having a conference out next week and we wish you good luck . @!Prof-AMIN : Thank you very much and welcome your participation and your leadership in this area . @!FLATOW : Thanks for joining us . Have a good weekend . @!Prof-AMIN : Thank you . '
