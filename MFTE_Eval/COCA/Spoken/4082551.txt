##4082551 BRET @!BAIER , FOX NEWS ANCHOR : Good evening . I 'm Bret Baier . And this is a FOX News alert . Republicans gearing up to take a run at President Obama next year in a mega money campaign have a new leader , as the party elects its next chairman . We have FOX team coverage tonight . White House correspondent Mike Emanuel tells us the president is getting his people together for what could be a billion dollar re-election campaign . But we begin with chief political correspondent Carl Cameron with the breaking news . Good evening , Carl . @!CARL-CAMERON-FOX- : Hi , Bret . It took seven ballots for the 168 members of the Republican National Committee to replace their embattled chairman Michael Steele . The new GOP chief will be Reince Priebus , the chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party . And in post-victory remarks , he immediately focused on the upcoming 2012 battle and the billion dollar election campaign Republicans plan to oust the Democrat currently in the White House . @!REINCE-PRIEUS-RNC : We have to get on track . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unified as a committee . @!CAMERON-@1voice-ov : During Steele 's controversial two-year tenure , the party 's national budget went from a big surplus to $21 million in debt . Unable to win re-election after four ballots , Steele dropped out of the race . @!MICHAEL-STEELE-FM : So I really thank you for the chairmanship of this party , for the two years that I 've had . And at this time , I will step aside for others to lead . But in so doing , I hope you all appreciate the legacy we leave . Despite the noise , we 've had -- Lord knows we had a lot of noise , have n't we , Dan ? Despite the difficulties , we won . @!CAMERON : Steele endorsed one of his four rivals over the rest , long-time RNC official Maria Cino , who was also backed by House Speaker John Boehner . Former Michigan Republican chairman Saul Anuzis and former national party co-chairwoman Ann Wagner brought up the rear through the early balloting as Reince Priebus , the RNC 's counsel under Steele inched into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 112th Congress plot its strategy . Congress returns to work next week and House Republicans plan a vote to repeal the health care law . The GOP knows it has no chance with the **25;82;TOOLONG Senate or the president . @!ERIC-CANTOR-@1R-VA : We as Republicans do not control this federal government . The other party does . @!CAMERON : Angry Democrats called the GOP move to repeal the health care act , quote , " the patient 's right to repeal act . " But in the wake of the Tucson assassination attempt on Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords , Republicans and Democrats alike have suggested that for the sake of unity , they may sit together instead of divided by party for the president 's State of the Union address the 25th. @!KEVIN-MCCARTHY-@1R : And I think the action that you 're seeing , those members are now saying hey , yes , why do n't we sit next to one another ? We are all one House . @!CAMERON : And from Baltimore , already reaction to the Priebus victory has been coming in . Praise from House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer their congratulations and thanks . The party now putting its eyes on a big reorganization and a massive fundraising effort , fully aware that the battle to oust Barack Obama is their major priority and it will be a very expensive one , Bret. @!BAIER : Carl Cameron live at the National Harbor in Maryland . Carl , thank you . Then Senator Obama 's 2008 presidential campaign raised $745 million . White House correspondent Mike Emanuel reports getting even more money next time will be a huge challenge . @!MIKE-EMANUEL-FOX- : A year ahead of the first votes cast in the 2012 election cycle , supporters of President Obama are already working on a donor base that raised a record-breaking amount in 2008 . Although Mr. Obama says he 's still focused on this year . @!BARACK-OBAMA-PRES : There will plenty of time to campaign for 2012 , in 2012 , and that our job this year is to make sure that we build on the recovery . @!EMANUEL : Among the signs the re-election effort will start soon , key advisers David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs are scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plus reality is setting in that the 2012 election may cost the Obama team up to $1 billion after the president 's party lost the House . @!NEERA-TANDEN-CENT : We 'll add the Democrats who were outspent two , three , four to one . And I think the White House is wary of that occurring in a presidential election cycle . @!EMANUEL : Another challenge Mr. Obama has regularly blasted one key money source . @!OBAMA : We did n't become the most prosperous country in the world just by rewarding greed and recklessness . We did n't do it just by gambling and chasing paper profits on Wall Street . @!EMANUEL : Mr. Obama also used the term " Wall Street fat cats . " One Obama Wall Street bundler , people who rally friends to give to a campaign vented last month to some of his hedge fund friends about the president . Third Point management founder Daniel Loeb wrote an e-mail , quote , " I mean he really loves us . And when he beats us , he does n't mean it . He just gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone with him at $30,000 a plate fund raisers , he 's really nice and once I got invited to the White House . " A former Republican National Committee chairman says one difference this time around is Mr. Obama has to run on his record . @!JIM-NICHOLSON-FOR : I 've seen their performance and especially the business people , and especially those in Wall Street and the financial service sector know the difference between their rhetoric and their actions . @!EMANUEL : Plus some who gave generously amid the historic nature of the 2008 campaign could potentially sit on their wallets. @!NICHOLSON : Big donors , a lot of them are pragmatic . And , you know , they run big businesses and they have to deal with the government . @!EMANUEL : The argument is that will lead to cautious giving in the early stages to allow those donors to get a better sense of Mr. Obama 's chances for re-election -- Bret. @!BAIER : Mike Emanuel live on the North Lawn . Mike , thank you . Republican Herman Cain is in Iowa after announcing earlier this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . Cain is an Atlanta-based businessman , the former chairman and CEO of Godfather 's Pizza and a radio talk show host . He lost a bid for U.S. Senate seat , a U.S. Senate seat in Georgia in 2004 . One of President Obama 's biggest problems right now is overseas , in Pakistan . Insurgents run rampant . The government is unstable , and the country has nuclear weapons . Today , President Obama met with Pakistan 's president . White House correspondent Wendell Goler tells us how it went . @!WENDELL-GOLER-FOX : President Zardari was in Washington for a memorial service for Richard Holbrooke who called his last job , U.S. envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan , the most difficult of a nearly 50-year career . Aides say President Obama 's talks with Zardari focused on the U.S.-Pakistan relationship which in the ceremony , Mr. Obama said Holbrooke left his mark on . @!BARACK-OBAMA-PRES : With Pakistan , he created new habits of cooperation to overcome decades of mistrust . @!GOLER : Across Pakistan , a wave of suspected ethnic and politically motivated killings continued as did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Punjab earlier this month for defending a Christian woman condemned to death under the nation 's blasphemy law . Vice President Biden in Pakistan earlier this week warned the murder ca n't be excused. @!JOE-BIDEN-VICE-PR : As we 've seen throughout history , societies that tolerate such actions end up being consumed by those actions . @!GOLER : Aides say Presidents Obama and Zardari also discussed the blasphemy law which critics say is used to persecute . Mark Quarterman who directed the U.N . ' s inquiry into the assassination of Zardari 's late wife , Benazir Bhutto , says the angry wave of intolerance is chillingly familiar . @!MARK-QUARTERMAN-C : That rising , rising rhetoric calls to arms against her for her modernizing ways helped to result in her death . @!GOLER : Since 9/11 , the hunt for Al Qaeda has been the main focus of the U.S.-Pakistan relationship . Zardari 's government has come under fire for tolerating U.S. drone attacks against Al Qaeda leaders which his critics call a violation of sovereignty . It 's still not clear if the protests will threaten Zardari 's government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from institutionalizing the tolerance necessary to be an effective democracy and U.S. priorities may need to change . @!QUARTERMAN : In many ways , Pakistan is a more serious national security issue for the United States than neighboring Afghanistan , which we spend much more time talking about . @!GOLER-@1on-camera@ : Still , even if the U.S. does come to recognize Pakistan as a bigger concern than Afghanistan , Quarterman says the changes that Pakistan need to make are very much in the hands of its own people . At the White House , Wendell Goler , FOX News . @!BAIER : President Obama is loosening rules on travel to Cuba . Students and church groups will be allowed to visit the communist nation . The release from the White House came out tonight . Rules on sending money to people there also will be changed . Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida , a Cuban-American responds , quote , " It is unthinkable that the administration would enable the enrichment of a Cuban regime that routinely violates the basic human rights and dignity of its people . " Tunisia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared a state of emergency and took off . But Correspondent Greg Palkot reports he left plenty of problems in his rear-view mirror . @!GREG-PALKOT-FOX-N : There is turmoil on a key North African ally of the United States . After weeks of protests , Tunisian President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali ( ph ) left the country ending 23 years of authoritarian rule . The country 's prime minister , Mohamed Ghannouchi , announced on state TV he was assuming power temporarily . " I asked the people of Tunisia , " he said , " to hold on to our national spirit . " And for unity to enable our dear country to get through this difficult period . " Protests among thousands of young people were triggered by economic concerns , high food prices and unemployment . And then became political on the charges of corruption and lack of democracy . In recent days , dozens were reportedly killed by Tunisian security forces fueling the protests further . Last night , Ben Ali himself went on TV to announce various concessions , including saying he would n't run for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency was declared . Watching all this closely is the United States , which despite having reservations about the Ben Ali regime , viewed it as a relative moderate Muslim voice on Mideast peace issues . In a statement late today , President Obama urged calm and called on the Tunisian government to , quote , " hold free and fair elections in the near future that reflect the true will and aspirations of the Tunisian people . " Tunisia has been a key ally in the fight against terror , in particular , dealing with a dangerous regional chapter of Al Qaeda , Al Qaeda in the Maghreb or North Africa . Just yesterday , a spokesman for the group allegedly offered its backing and support for the protesters and against the government . : Also , no doubt , watching events in Tunisia closely , aging and embattled leaders of the Mideast perhaps wondering if young crowds in their country can repeat what happened there . In London , Greg Palkot , FOX News . @!BAIER : He was heralded as a historic leader of the Catholic church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sainthood . But first , less than a week after the Arizona shootings , lawmakers are again meeting with their constituents . @!BAIER : The neurosurgeon treating Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords says she is opening her eyes more frequently now and is getting better at following commands . Giffords was shot in the head last Saturday during that constituent meeting . The funeral of one of those killed , Federal Judge John Roll was held today . The service was at the same church that Thursday hosted the funeral for another victim , 9-year-old Christina Taylor Green . Many lawmakers have been holding the same kind of get-togethers this week as Giffords was attending when she was shot . But senior correspondent Rick Leventhal reports a lot has changed in seven days . @!RICK-LEVENTHAL-FO : They were once routine events with little fanfare or concern . But Congress on your corner gatherings have a new dimension to them now . The attack on Democratic Congresswoman Giffords outside a Tucson grocery store left six dead , 13 wounded , and sent a sobering message to elected officials and their constituents that safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . And so help me , God , speaking for myself , I will not let one 22-year-old sick , deranged soul in Arizona change what I do . @!LEVENTHAL : Republican Representative Joe Walsh is one of many members of Congress adopting a defiant tone , determined to send the message that the Arizona shooter ca n't stop democracy . And Congress on your corner events are core examples of how government is supposed to work . Face-to- face meetings with the people , hearing firsthand what 's working and what is n't . Taking the concerns back to Capitol Hill to try and make a difference . @!CHRIS-MURPHY-@1D@2 : People , you know , expressed their condolences and sympathies but they wanted to get back to talking about the issues . @!LEVENTHAL : However , security is now a priority . A police officer stood guard for Democratic Congressman Chris Murphy 's event in front of a Connecticut grocery store . @!MURPHY : I want to show them that we can continue to have open and civil conversations about the direction of our country . And no madman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to talk . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Knowing what happened in Arizona , and seeing him stand out here and meet his constituents , I thought right on , that 's great . @!LEVENTHAL : Democrat Shelly Berkeley of Nevada asked police to attend her gathering in Las Vegas to look out for copycat attackers . : Several other members of Congress held similar town hall style meetings with constituents this week , all with similar themes . Honoring Representative Giffords while preserving the essence of what makes this nation strong . In New York . Rick Leventhal , FOX News . @!BAIER : Stocks were up on the final day of the week . The Dow gained 55 1/2 . The S&amp;P 500 finished ahead 9 1/2 . The Nasdaq picked up 20 . Oil prices continue to inch up toward $100 a barrel . Futures gained 14 cents today to close at $91.54 a barrel . The national average for gasoline stands at just under $3.10 a gallon . That 's up a penny from last week . We 've been telling you this week about the emerging difficulties for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chief Washington correspondent Jim Angle tells us about an even greater concern . @!JIM-ANGLE-FOX-NEW : There is no bigger financial problem facing the federal government than Medicare . And its shadow will fall on both seniors and younger taxpayers because unlike social security , some of the astronomical cost of Medicare comes directly out of annual federal revenues . @!CHARLES-BLAHOUS-M : The way that they work is that , as costs rise , they just result in bigger taxpayer burdens on future generations . @!ANDREW-BIGGS-AMER : Medicare long-term deficit is somewhere around $85 trillion . Medicare is an enormous , enormous problem facing the federal budget . @!ANGLE : And the problems with Medicare come a lot sooner than other entitlements . The new chairman of the House Budget Committee says the day of reckoning is right around the corner . @!PAUL-RYAN-@1R-WI@2 : Because the tens of trillions of dollars of unfunded liabilities are right out there in front of us , Medicare is going insolvent later in the decade . And Medicare is the greatest cause of our debt problems . @!ANGLE : That 's because Medicare faces a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as baby boomers retire . Two , an aging population uses more health care . And three , prices on medical care keep rising . And the liberal defender of the program also warns of the problems ahead . @!ROBERT-GREENSTEIN , : If we want the country to have advances in medicine , we 're going to have to pay somewhat higher taxes . If we do n't want the taxes to go up , we 're going to have to have increasingly large rationing of health care . @!ANGLE : But analysts warn seniors about to sign up they did n't pay for as much in taxes as they 're going to receive anyway . @!BIGGS : The problem is for the typical person , the amount of money they paid in Medicare taxes is nowhere near enough to pay for the benefits they 'll receive over their retirement . @!ANGLE : But without changes , the young will suffer the most . @!RYAN : If you 're under 55 years old , guess what , we 've got news for you . It 's not going to be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicare to seniors at that time if we keep this he program going as it is. @!ANGLE : Ryan says there is one inescapable fact . The benefit- consuming generation is increasing by 100 percent while the taxpaying generation , which will have to fund Medicare , is only growing by 17 percent . As they say where I grew up , Bret , you ca n't get there from here . @!BAIER : That 's right , Jim . Thanks . @!ANGLE : You bet . @!BAIER : Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says she has canceled the virtual fence project along the southern border with Mexico . The system of cameras and sensors has been plagued by delays and technological glitches . Napolitano says she will pursue a new plan for border security . Texas gets creative in raising revenue . We 'll tell you about a bit later . And up next , trying to avoid creating another war . @!BAIER : Defense Secretary Robert Gates says new disarmament talks with North Korea are possible only if the regime backs off recent aggression . Correspondent James Rosen has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anew of the threat posed by North Korea 's nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs , Defense Secretary Gates nonetheless offered some mildly reassuring words about the prospect of war on the peninsula . @!ROBERT-GATES-DEFE : North Korea 's ability to launch another conventional ground invasion is much degraded from even a decade ago . @!ROSEN : Gates visit to Seoul came two months after the North shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong , killing two marines and two civilians . And amid heightened anxiety that the ongoing succession process in the regime and family of Kim Jong-il will produce further escalation . @!KIM-KWAN-JIN-SOUT : Many expect North Korea to conduct more provocations this year . I believe that strong force is the only measure to effectively cope with the threats posed by North Korea . @!ROSEN : And the secretary who is soon to leave the Obama cabinet disclosed some startling intelligence about the , quote/unquote , " disconnect , " separating China 's military and civilian leaders . @!GATES : We think that the civilian leadership was not aware of the aggressive approach by the Chinese ships to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our information is that the civilian leadership may not have known about the anti-satellite test that was conducted about three years ago . @!ROSEN : Those disclosures come ahead of Wednesday 's visit to Washington by Chinese President Hu Jintao . At the State Department , Secretary Clinton said America 's relationship with China stands at a critical juncture if that relationship is ever to live up to its promise . @!HILLARY-CLINTON-S : It is up to both of us to translate high level pledges of summits and state visits into action . Real action on real issues . @!ROSEN : One of the real issues on which the U.S. will press the Chinese next week is for Beijing to prod its client state , North Korea , to take what Gates called concrete steps toward denuclearization . Only once that has happened , Gates said . Will the U.S. be willing to restart those long stalled Six-party talks with the North , Bret ? @!BAIER : James , thank you . Australia has begun to tally the multibillion dollar toll of massive flooding that swamped its third largest city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push up world food prices . Mining companies also say they may not be able to meet contracts for coal , Australia 's biggest export . And flooding in Brazil has already killed at least 509 people . More rain is falling today hindering rescuers efforts to reach survivors in mountain towns . This is Brazil 's worst natural disaster since flooding killed 785 people back in 1967 . One of the Catholic church 's most beloved figures is a little bit closer to sainthood . Correspondent Greg Burke fills us in from Rome . @!GREG-BURKE-FOX-NE : When Pope John Paul II died in April of 2005 after nearly 27 years as pontiff , some people began calling him " John Paul the great . " Others asked that the church make him a saint right away . @!AUSTEN-IVEREIGH-C : You remember in the scenes at his funeral when the crowds were shouting , " Santo Subito , " make him a saint . @!BURKE : Now John Paul is only one step away as Pope Benedict determined that his predecessor will be declared blessed in a ceremony in Rome on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event could draw a million people to Rome . While Pope John Paul still has a huge following in his native Poland , there 's also widespread popular devotion around the globe for the man many credit with having helped bring down the Berlin wall . JIM @!NICHOLSON , FMR US AMBASSADOR TO THE HOLY SEE : He 's the guy that really , you know , along with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and Lech Walesa and others , but they loosed the world from the yoke of communism . @!BURKE : Pope Benedict made only one exception of the saint-making rule for Pope John Paul . He waived the requirement to wait five years before the process gets started . And while some critics charged that the church needs to take a closer look at how John Paul dealt with the sex abuse crisis , Pope Benedict is clearly convinced the man was a saint . : Part of the saint-making process involves a miracle and in this case the Vatican says it was the inexplicable cure of a French nun suffering from Parkinson 's who prayed to John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to become a full-fledged saint . In Rome , Greg Burke , FOX News . @!BAIER : We will tell you why the lawyer for the accused WikiLeakers says his client should be freed from jail . And one senator and a few other lawmakers want to make a radical change to the State of the Union address . " The Grapevine " is coming up . @!BAIER : And now some fresh pickings from the " Political Grapevine . " As you heard in Carl Cameron 's piece , this year 's " State of the Union " address could butt 200 years of tradition . Colorado Democratic Senator Mark Udall wants both parties to scrap the practice of sitting on separate sides of the House chamber , instead encouraging them to sit shoulder to shoulder in the speech . A few senators , some lawmakers have voiced support of that plan , along with both the majority and minority whips in the House . There are actually no rules stipulating who sits where , except for VIPs . But political analyst Larry Sabato sees merit in the age-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stands as a unit is because members are tied together by common beliefs . When the parties applaud and stand at different moments in the president 's speech , it actually helps the public understand what each party believes in . " The lawyer for accused WikiLeaker Private First Class Bradley Manning , wants his client out of confinement because he says Manning is being held in harsh condition . The United Nations special representative on torture has even asked the State Department for an update on the soldier 's treatment ? But the military 's says conditions at the marine corps brig in Virginia are standard and includes seven hours of uninterrupted sleep , daily exercise , showers , phone calls , meetings with lawyers , and weekend visits from family and friends . TV , books , and magazines are also available . Manning 's lawyers say the conditions are more rigorous than necessary , but that the guards acted professionally . As for the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , he is currently staying at a supporter 's country mansion in Britain and recently announced a $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Islamic Relations , or CAIR , says it will remove a poster from its website encouraging people not to talk to FBI . The post shows a sinister-looking agent that reads " Build a wall of resistance . Do n't talk to the FBI . " It was first produced in the 1970s . CAIR used it to promote a conference called " FBI Raids and Grand Jury Subpoenas , know your rights and defend all communities . " The CAIR spokesman says the poster is subject to misinterpretation and removed out of , quote , extreme caution . The state of Texas is putting a new twist on an old idea for sake of the public coffers . Correspondent Kris Gutierrez has the story . @!KRIS-GUTIERREZ-FO : What would you pay for a personalized license plate ? In Texas , people drop big money at the state 's first ever license plate auction . The new seven-character plates up for grabs from favorite hobbies to family values to sports teams . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : I played $11,500 for a Cowboys plate . @!GUTIERREZ : Facing a $27 billion deficit over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ways to bring in money . They hired mystates.com to market and sell personalized plates and Texas will receive a cut of the money from 50 to 90 percent . To date , the program has generated more than $2.5 million for state general revenue fund . @!STEVE-FARRAR-MYPL : The program is guaranteed $25 million over the next five years . We 're well on track to deliver on that . @!GUTIERREZ : Last night 's auction brought in more than $139,000 , and roughly $84,000 will go to the state . Adam Richie paid $10,000 to show support for his favorite baseball team . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : I 'm a big Rangers fan and a fan of the state of Texas . Why not ? Ten grand . @!GUTIERREZ-@1on-cam : Was it worth it ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : I do n't know about that . @!GUTIERREZ-@1voice- : In some cases people paid more for the plate than the vehicle is worth . @!GUTIERREZ-@1on-cam : This was the big winner .
