 One Atlanta-based company sells roast beef sandwiches and the Frosty . Another makes folding cartons for fast food . 
That 's where the similarities end for Wendy's/Arby 's Group and Rock-Tenn Co . Both made big mergers and acquisitions news over the past week and a half , for different reasons . 
Rock-Tenn , built on a string of business consolidations over the past 113 years , just proposed its largest yet : a $3.5 billion takeover of Smurfit-Stone , a larger producer of containerboard , the stuff that makes moving boxes . If approved , the deal will triple Rock-Tenn 's size . 
Ten miles to the west , leaders of Wendy's/Arby 's have encountered the flip side of a merger . They want to break up the company less than three years after pulling the two brands together . 
The divergent paths underscore the difficulty of crafting a successful merger or takeover . Such deals create some of the diciest issues in American business : cultural clashes , loss of talented employees and financial benefits that prove elusive . Tread carefully in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how 75 percent of all people consider themselves above-average drivers ? Well , 75 percent of executives probably think they 're above-average deal-makers , " said Marc C. D'Annunzio , a member of the Siavage Law Group in Atlanta . " Which is impossible . " 
Rock-Tenn traces its roots back to Rock City Box Co. , which was founded in Nashville in 1898 . Thirty-eight years later , a Baltimore businessman named Arthur Newth Morris started the Southern Box Co. , which bought Rock City in 1944 , in the midst of World War II . In 1973 , Morris company merged with a 56-year-old Chattanooga firm called Tennessee Paper Mills to form Rock-Tenn Co. 
From its headquarters in Norcross , Rock-Tenn operates in quiet . That 's the low-profile nature of the packaging business , chief executive Jim Rubright said . 
" All of our customers have a brand identity or a product identity , but ours does n't , " he said . " The general public does n't know the hundreds of times they touch our products , and they do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That dark-horse approach might be harder to pull off now . Rock-Tenn , adept at churning out and managing cash and paying off debt quickly , is " an emerging industry thoroughbred , " Deutsche Bank analyst Mark Wilde said . 
It is risky for a company such as Rock-Tenn -- - which has less experience in producing containerboard than does Smurfit-Stone -- - to buy an industry leader in that segment , said Mark Connelly , an analyst with Credit Agricole Securities . But Rock-Tenn got a good enough deal to protect itself even if prices for its products fall , Connelly wrote . 
Rubright insists his company is not looking for " fixer-upper " assets . He likes the fact that Smurfit-Stone invested $550 million in its facilities recently , but added that those plants could be made more efficient . 
" We want to be the most respected company in the industry , " he said . " We 're always looking for very good companies . " 
Rock-Tenn has completed about a dozen acquisitions stretching back to 1973 , including Gulf States Paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those deals helped put it in the big leagues . Its latest will be the boldest yet . 
In recent years , Smurfit-Stone has been dogged by a reputation as the packaging sector 's most troubled company . Smurfit-Stone emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2010 and had no permanent executive-level leadership at the time of Rock-Tenn 's takeover bid . The state of limbo hurt morale , as speculation swirled that the company 's board was looking for takeover bids. 
Rubright said he is encouraged that a number of Smurfit-Stone 's leaders plan to stay with the combined company and help run the industrial operations . " These are very strong people that we know , and we 've spoken with , and we 're counting on them to stay with us , " he said . " We think it 's very important . " 
Wendy's/Arby 's faces the mirror-image task : how to untangle two big brands . The company has more than 10,000 restaurants , making it one of the country 's largest fast-food chains and one of Atlanta 's most recognizable brands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arby 's logo , visible for blocks around . 
That sign notwithstanding , the company now wants to focus on Wendy 's . The brand dates back to Columbus , Ohio , where Dave Thomas opened his first " Wendy 's Old Fashioned Hamburgers " in 1969 . The parent company is spending millions to rehab Wendy 's menu and stores , and plans to open new restaurants in Argentina . But it will do so without Arby 's . Analysts say $600 million or more might be sought for the brand . 
What went wrong ? Blair Chancey , editor of QSR , said the rise of Panera and similar sandwich establishments stole some of the thunder at Arby 's . Meal prices in the $7 range became increasingly difficult to pull off as Americans cut their meal budgets . Vicki Bryan , a bond analyst at Gim me Credit , said the brand 's marketing does n't target an identifiable niche . 
" They had a lot of competition coming from a lot of different angles , " Chancey said . 
The parent company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Nelson Peltz , Wendy's/Arby 's chairman and architect of the deal in which the smaller Arby 's operation merged with Wendy 's , grew impatient and publicly put Arby 's up for sale on Jan. 20. 
" So ends more than a decade of recycled strategies and numerous management changes that failed to jump-start the struggling brand , " Bryan wrote . 
In ironic timing , Arby 's recently posted better results . Sales grew in the fourth quarter at restaurants that were open at least a year . It was the first time since the merger that the Wendy 's and Arby 's brands both accomplished that feat . Those results will probably improve the prospects of an Arby 's sale , said analyst Sara Senatore . But profit margins have narrowed , and that is worrisome. 
" Maybe it 's better to acknowledge your mistake " and break up the company , Chicago analyst R.J. Hottovy said . " Peltz has never been shy about doing a deal . " 
Business school libraries are littered with major deals that failed in spectacular fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local corporate and securities attorney Sandy Smith called " the agony of victory , " split apart after the old and new media wings failed to work together . 
Among some loyal Chicago shoppers , Macy 's never recovered from the backlash after it bought Marshall Field 's and replaced the retailer 's green and white logo with the red Macy 's star . 
German automaker Daimler might have made better cup-holders than Chrysler , but when it came to decision-making , " They were n't very good , " said Usha C. V. Haley , professor of international business at Massey University in New Zealand . American executives felt their German counterparts cut them out . DaimlerChrysler no longer exists . 
The takeover of Anheuser-Busch by cost-cutting Belgian brewer InBev precipitated what once seemed impossible : a grassroots boycott campaign in Anheuser-Busch 's hometown of St. Louis . 
Bankers , lawyers , consultants and executives often fail to adequately plan the post-merger integration , Haley said . They are skilled at accounting for physical and financial assets , but often not as good at the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bean counters , " she said , " but they are counting the wrong beans . " 
In any case , buyers are more disciplined than they used to be , industry experts say . Back in the go-go days of the late 1990s , executives at acquiring companies might spend only 12 hours in windowless " data rooms " with their lawyers and accountants , poring over a seller 's books . The timeline was compressed ; the pressure to buy , intense . 
But less generous credit markets forced potential buyers to slow down and put more time into due diligence . By their own choice or not , buyers now have more time to poke and prod . That is showing up in the results . Corporate deal-makers outperformed their non-acquisitive peers on a global basis in the fourth quarter of 2010 , according to Towers Watson , a global professional services firm . Companies completing two or more deals over the past 30 months fared even better . 
" Practice makes perfect : you learn how to add value , " said David Hinkel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person 's damaged brand is another person 's opportunity . "
