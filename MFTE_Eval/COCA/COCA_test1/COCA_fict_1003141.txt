THE WHITE BLOUSE Sylvia has to wear to work in the restaurant is soiled at the end of the day with soup , with cocoa , with chocolate , with cream . It 's hanging over a chair . The sweat has seeped into the lace collar .  She keeps dreaming she wakes up and has to go to work . So she keeps trotting through the restaurant with her tray , even when she 's asleep , squeezes herself between customers , moves back and forth from the tables to the kitchen : one order on top of the other . She can not switch off the movement . When she wakes up , she hears herself screaming above the restaurant 's numbing hum . Even though she wrote everything down , there is always a new order she ca n't remember .  That is the way she sleeps . The blouse is a white blot in the room . The alarm clock is set half an hour early . When it rings she jumps up , pushes the button down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the dream again , piling everything up in the five minutes between alarms . That is the way she wakes up every morning , the way she works every day , the way she sleeps every night . She thinks : there will be a time when I wo n't get up . Here , or somewhere else , outside , I do n't know where .  " They still have n't found that woman that worked in the kitchen with us , you know . "  " What happened ? "  " What do you mean what happened ? Her husband came over here . When his wife still was n't home at night . But we were all closed up here . At night . Of course we 're all closed up here . I do n't know what he did then . That I do n't know . She just did n't come home . And then the next morning . That was a sight for sore eyes , that was . They broke open her locker to look . We all have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they should n't break it open , they should n't . It 's like your personal locker , you know ? And then they waited for her husband in the morning . And that 's when all tongues start wagging , of course . But he had to go to work . What do you expect , it was morning . But her husband was allowed to come then , anyway . He must have got time off at work . Together with the director . The director must have asked if he could get time off , I guess . They were all standing here , in the hallway that leads to the kitchen . And then they broke open her locker . But they did n't find anything . They thought maybe a letter or something . But they did n't find anything . Just her things and stuff . For work . You have to have at least two members of staff present , you know , and one of the bosses , before they can break open your locker . And they poked around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself : maybe she 's dead by now and they 're poking around in her things , just like that . I could n't stay there . I said to myself : this is not going to work . I did n't stay there . I could n't .  " And now they 're still looking for her . The police say it only floats to the surface on the fourth day . It always does . Four days , they say . They all float to the surface after four days . If she drowned herself , that is . But they did n't tell her husband that , of course they would n't . Imagine . The director , yes . But he did n't say anything about it either . Probably not allowed to , I guess . Because of the children . "  " What ? "  " That 's what I was going to say , maybe because of the children . "  " That must be bad . "  " That 's the worst , I guess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go and do a thing like that . Her , that 's her business , but those children . I 've been thinking about them a lot . "  " And him ? Does he have to go to work ? "  " Well of course , what do you think ? Of course he has to go to work . I do n't know how he does it either . When he has to go to work . I keep thinking what does he do when he comes home at night -- " ( Cries ) .  In the morning Sylvia eats only a little mandarin orange . She picks up her bag that is standing on the table and checks to see that the cigarettes , the lighter , the handkerchiefs , and the purse are inside . At the front door she drops in the keys . She maneuvers her bicycle out of the hallway , weaving between two trash cans . Then she pulls the door closed .
