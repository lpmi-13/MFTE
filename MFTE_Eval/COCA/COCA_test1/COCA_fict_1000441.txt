Hannah Farr was 16 the spring she left home to live with a strange man . Her two older brothers still living at home had been ordered to carry her little trunk down the stairs and out to Mr. Bates ' buckboard . Her mother kissed her briefly in the front hall and her gangling brothers mumbled their goodbyes , awkward in their confusion , not knowing whether to make a joke of it or treat it like a funeral . After she 'd climbed up into the seat , and looked back at the house , she expected to see the three of them waving goodbye . But they 'd all gone inside . It hardly seemed right , but she had n't much choice in the matter .  The year was 1849 , and times had been hard for the Farr family since the death of Hannah 's father . He had been a lawyer with all the proper degrees , one even from Bowdoin , but as Hannah 's mother often said with a sniff , Mr. Farr lacked a litigious nature . With him gone , there was no one whom Hannah could ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his insurance company had failed . Her mother seemed to blame him for being too gentle , too kind , and too interested in botany . How could she hold all that against such a wonderful man ?  What Hannah remembered best were their walks together . She , his youngest , helped him to collect leaves from a great variety of trees and shrubs . He identified them , labeled them in Latin . Later she would help him press the specimens in large volumes . During the long Maine winters they would haul out those books , pouring over them , recalling where they found each one .  Hannah 's mother explained that God was testing them all by taking their provider so early . She never blamed her sons who , after shameful indifference in school , resigned themselves to temporary work as clerks or choreboys at the livery or lying about the house between jobs in idleness . Now , jouncing on the slat-seat of the buckboard with the dour and aging Mr. Bates , Hannah decided that if the Lord was indeed testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special trial . Why else would He have sent her out to live in a strange village miles away . And not with a grand man either . A bit humiliating being picked up in a buckboard rather than a proper carriage .  " Will it be quite different , " she finally managed to ask , " where you live ? "  " Winters are a tad less aggravating . "  She had noticed that when he talked with her mother he kept his eyes on the ground like the country man he clearly was . Here , he looked directly at his horse 's rump-or perhaps out at the dirt road before him . Certainly not at her .  " Is it to the south , then ? " she asked .  " Nope . " And there it rested for some time . She had about decided that the conversation was over when he added , " It 's the sea what does it . We 're on the coast . "  So this was what it was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like throwing scraps to the chickens . She 'd hoped there might be a silver lining in being free from her brothers with their roughhousing and crude jokes , but this Mr. Bates seemed like a poor trade-a hard old thing with a country accent and the faint odor of fish . Still , she must n't complain . As her father used to say , whining shrivels the heart .  Her mother had told her a hundred times that she was not about to be a hired girl . No daughter of hers would be sent out to be a hired girl . Mr. Bates , a lobsterman by trade , was a distant cousin . Not a kissing cousin to be sure , but a blood relative on her father 's side . And in need . Not only was his mother ailing , his brother needed guidance-whatever that meant . Since Mr. Bates was in , Hannah would eat with the family . He had agreed to send a certain amount-never uttered aloud-to her mother . Plus a dollar a week directly to Hannah for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times her mother assured her that she was not a hired girl .  The Bates farm was eight miles from the town of Codman where Hannah had been born and raised . She had never been that far away . She and Mr. Bates had left after lunch , and he hoped to make it by supper time . After the first half hour they had traveled farther than she had ever roamed in her berrying or leaf hunting with her father .  The road had been fairly firm when they started-only an inch or two of mud over the lingering spring frost . But as they descended a long , gradual hill , she could see a desolate stretch of shrubby growth . Some fields had been cleared for pasturage , but the rest was a mix of juniper , chokeberry , and blueberry . It was early spring and nothing had leafed out yet . It looked to her like the Slough of Despond .  " This here 's the flats , " he said . She nodded , not knowing whether this was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand like this . Could give us trouble . "
