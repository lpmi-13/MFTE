Previously on The Originals ... INADU : You will give me a safe place to hide . When you die , so too does your entire sire line . The great sacrifice , which will return me to flesh and blood . FREYA : If Elijah is going to die one way or another , then I can try placing his soul inside the pendant . Get Elijah into the pendant ! - [yells] - Hurry , she 's killing him ! FREYA : Animam suam . I can feel him ! [urgent_chanting] She 's taken Elijah 's power . The Hollow will be reborn . My brother 's soul is in that pendant . We need to bring him back . His original body is where he belongs . And now that his mind is stable within the pendant , I can bring him back , I just ... need a large enough sacrifice . You 're thinking what I 'm thinking . Kill the Hollow , save our brother . Do me a favor and watch yourself . What if I told you I could bring Davina back to life ? - Are you really back ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , if you want to keep her safe , then you belong to me . Davina ? DAVINA : I 'm right here . [sighs] Oh , for a moment , I thought ... It 's okay . I 'm still me . Flesh and blood , alive , for now . And linked to that monster . I promise , I 'm gon na find a way out of this for you . She was powerful enough to bring me back from the dead . Kol , you have no idea what we 're up against . Has n't stopped me before . Stay here . I 'll be back as soon as I can . Wait , you 're leaving ? Kol , we might not have much time together . Losing you broke me . I will not stand around and let it happen again . The Hollow has to be killed . And if she dies , then I die . And what 's the alternative , you help her ? You ca n't betray your family . That 's kind of my specialty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked for some time alone with her before you use me to do your dirty work . You have been dead 1,500 years , surely you can spare an hour . Every second counts if you want Davina to continue breathing . What is it that you need , then ? Am I to handle your errands ? Or your laundry ? It 's actually quite simple . I have long wanted to be mortal , but now that I am alive , I can die . In fact , your own family is relentless in their quest to kill me . Look , if you want me to put in a good word , that ship has sailed , darling . I have my own protection spell , cast in the form of a totem . You will safeguard my totem , until I 'm done with your family . If you falter , if any harm comes my way , Davina will suffer with me . The Hollow , she 's getting stronger . You can sense her ? When we first got here , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she came back , it 's so quiet . Like she 's draining everything out of the city . She already took Uncle Elijah . And soon she will come for the rest of us . Listen , Hope , I know you 're scared . But over the years , a lot of bad people have stood against our family , and all of them have fallen . The Hollow is no different . No , she is different . ? ? [crackling] [crackling] [crackling] FREYA : Despite the spell I cast , the very integrity of the pendant is growing unstable . It wo n't be able to hold Elijah 's soul much longer . We need to find a way to resurrect him tonight , or we could lose him forever . To do that , we 'll need more power . Let me guess , a grand sacrifice . I say we kill our enemy and sacrifice her , then I can channel the power from the Hollow 's death , raise Elijah 's body , and place him back where he belongs .
