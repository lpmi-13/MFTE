An improvement to how obituaries are done ? November 24 , 2012 7:44 AM Subscribe  It might be time to consider how obituaries are posted on the Blue .  The most beloved and complemented entries on metafilter are the ones where somebody researches a subject thoroughly , provides significant links , and also gives a more reasoned view of a subject .  Except for obituaries . Then , it 's a race to the bottom , as people post one or two lines about a person , and if you get the feed for metafilter , you can see how many duplicates are posted in a short period of time .  So , might it be possible in the case of breaking obituaries , to post a placeholder text with the date , and then people work elsewhere for a more refined , link-filled and respectful obituary that takes its place later ?  Really , it seems to me the problem is people being in a hurry to get the link up . I 'm not totally sure we want to reward that behavior in general . We already do delete bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , rushed , breaking-news posts ) but I personally am in favor of figuring out a way to see less of those and get more fleshed-out , solid , readable obits. posted by restlessnomad ( staff ) at 7:54 AM on November 24 5 favorites  I 've never been real sure obituaries are a necessary thing on Metafilter . It 's a ' best of the web ' aggregator , not just a news aggregator . I would agree that if we 're going to have them , they certainly ought to be more than just a link to a single newspaper article ( assuming this is indeed prompted by the Larry Hagman obit ) . posted by Hargrimm at 7:54 AM on November 24 2 favorites  I 've never been real sure obituaries are a necessary thing on Metafilter .  They 're one of those situations where the ensuing discussion is regularly better than the post and the threads become really interesting . That said , there 's no reason to make do with rushed obits and over the past year or so we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's talk about it ! " without any real attention .  For a lot of people on MetaFilter , obit posts are their first posts . I think it 's because it 's an obvious " This is okay for MetaFilter " topic so that you 're usually not going to get a bunch of " Who cares " responses , your personal tastes wo n't be questioned or snarked at . So , I can see a place for obit posts , and I 've made a few of them myself , for people who I felt deserved them and who would n't otherwise merit posts here otherwise , but yeah the rushrushNEWS posts are n't so great .  I agree with everything you have to say , jscott , and I 'd honestly dig seeing an overhaul of Mefi obits . I know a few feeble attempts to do something about this issue have been made before ( the prewritten obits on the wiki were one such failure ) , but I just do n't see the Powers That Be changing things . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fun , to be proved completely wrong . Funny thing : even though I do think that over the last couple of years , the Mighty Hand of Deletion has grown swifter and heavier than I personally think it should have , I 'd be all for heavier moderation on obit posts . Maybe a queue for anything that 'll be categorized as an obit ? Yeah , I 'd be all for that . Or something else . I do n't know , and in the end I suppose I do n't care much one way or the other . Or maybe I do . Christ , I need to pull it together this morning . posted by item at 8:03 AM on November 24  Would it be possible to have a queue for anything tagged ' obit ' or ' obituary ' , or is this all really just a solution in search of a problem ? posted by item at 8:04 AM on November 24 1 favorite  Personally , I think the mods do a pretty good job of vetting the obit posts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judged by the mods , and , by the time the post would have hit the front page on MetaFilter , anyone who wants to talk about it has moved to some other online forum to do so . posted by HuronBob at 8:06 AM on November 24  by the time the post would have hit the front page on MetaFilter , anyone who wants to talk about it has moved to some other online forum to do so .  The thing is , this is fine . Metafilter is not for breaking news - never has been . If people want to talk about the latest headlines , they should be doing it on other sites . They should be able to come here for context and depth of discussion , not timeliness. posted by restlessnomad ( staff ) at 8:09 AM on November 24 34 favorites  Not that I remember ever disagreeing with HuronBob , but I 'm finding myself agreeing with HuronBob .  Yet the thread went along just fine and the article was later fleshed out , so today everything seems just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a specific problem here , especially one that needs a technical solution . posted by Brandon Blatcher at 8:15 AM on November 24 7 favorites  I enjoy the discussion that usually comes out of an obit post , but I enjoy it even more when I learn something new about the deceased person because of really interesting links in the original post . If I just wanted to read the NYT obit , I could just click over there .  The idea of an obit queue sounds like it might be workable , not so the mods have to judge the best entry , but to give them time to delete one link obits before the discussion gets too far to delete the thread . Another possibility could be to have a requirement of 3-5 links in an obit . That again gives the mods objective rather than subjective criteria for deletion. posted by SweetTeaAndABiscuit at 8:22 AM on November 24  I agree with the OP here , and I do n't think the fact that obituary threads generally go okay means there is n't something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The basic obituary-thread policy is inconsistent with MetaFilter in general . As has been stated , MetaFilter is n't a breaking-news site .
