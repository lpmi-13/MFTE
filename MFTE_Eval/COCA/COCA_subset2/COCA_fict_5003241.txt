We emerged at twilight , the last residents of the 500 block of North 127th Street . We sat on cement stoops and leaned against warped screen doors and waited for true night to arrive . My neighbors -- the two old women in the houses opposite mine , the family of four next door with the too-loud TV , Mr. Jenkins at the southern corner -- called out to each other by name . They nodded at me ; I nodded back . # It was summer and night was late in coming . The sky turned purple and litter swirled in the shadows . The stars came out , glittering in the sky like the blacktop glittered in the streetlights , just last evening . I stared at the sky , trying to find constellations learned from grade school text books . It might finally be possible to see them . # Soon my neighbors were just shapes , hovering at the edge of the gauzy spotlights their curtained windows cast . Everything else was invisible ; above us , the streetlights were invisible , but I knew they were there , standing in memorial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures , before the mayor had determined that the city could n't afford its energy bill , and the only option was to let this old neighborhood go . Like a field left to the weeds and the things that eat them . # Above me , a rash of stars , but no order in them . # I went inside and closed the deadbolt . I took a tour of the switches for the overheads and lamps , throwing blazes through the house . It was 200 years old , three stories high and 16 feet wide . The first floor held a combined living and dining room and a kitchen that opened to a cement patio ; the second floor offered a spare bedroom and only bathroom , as well as an alcove the realtor had staged as an office , an iron tree of tea candles set in the sealed fireplace ; and finally the top floor , Chris and my bedroom , a queen bed and cheap drapes concealing the boarded-up door to the deck . # The realtor had been near apoplectic when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , woken to the sound of the last flowerpots being smashed a few yards away . It had n't been her , stretching two layers of hospital latex gloves over her trembling hands to pick the pieces of a smashed hypodermic needle from the clumps of soil and smashed leaves . # I stood at the bedroom window , staring at my own reflection pasted over the invisible houses , and then I turned off the light and disappeared with them . # In the morning , I found socks balled on the bedroom floor , an orange-tinted glass in the sink . Chris had come and gone . His life had become a grim cycle of hospital overtime , drowsy commutes , brief and desperate sleep and bracing showers . # The 500 block of North 127th Street was laid bare : pitted concrete , wooden planks , glowing bricks , an uneven row of cars parked with one set of wheels on the curb , the only way to allow other cars to pass . # It was supposed to be gentrifying. # " It 's supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # " It 's not , " she said . We had gone to high school together . She had made mistakes , too ; specifically , six years of drinking . I was n't embarrassed to let her watch me dig deeper and deeper into my own mistake . I should have sold years ago , when it truly did seem like the neighborhood was changing for the better , or the more expensive , anyway . # " The last offer was way too low . " # " Look , you 're not losing your money , " she said . " Your mother bought the house . And you and your mother never got along anyway . So you 're not losing anything emotionally . " # " It 's worth more , " I insisted . I could n't stop insisting , to everyone , to myself . When I inherited the house , it seemed like a step toward a slightly better , slightly easier life ; now it was all I had . All I had beside Chris . # " Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your last chance . Not for any real money -- that 's all over -- but at least to be free . Start over . " She paused . " You know I 'm right . " # " Ok , " I said . There was a tremor in my voice . That 's all over . " Call them back . " # We hung up . " It 's worth something , " I said out loud . # Banging outside . I opened the door and leaned into the soupy morning . Mr. Jenkins was nailing boards to the front windows of the house next door . The glass was gone , but pale blue curtains were still gathered in the corner . # " They did n't tell you ? "
