
24/03/2020, 5:33 pm - $A: That's good.
24/03/2020, 5:34 pm - $C: I intended to do that and I suggested that on the group as well but I understood based on discussion here that this would be taxing for the students so I did not do it with my students. However, a video feedback could be one way of doing it. I'll be using it for my future sessions too then.
24/03/2020, 5:34 pm - $D: Sure.
24/03/2020, 5:36 pm - $C: Also i find that I'm unable to make a folder for resources on slate. Please help and walk me through the process as everytime i tried uploading resources separately on resources section and not within announcements the site malfunctioned.
24/03/2020, 5:36 pm - $B: Same!!
24/03/2020, 5:36 pm - $B: I need to know how it works!
24/03/2020, 5:37 pm - $A: Ok I will do that
24/03/2020, 5:37 pm - $A: Will make a document with screenshots and will share with you all.
24/03/2020, 5:40 pm - $H: I'm also not able to make the folder on slate.
24/03/2020, 5:41 pm - $A: I will make that
24/03/2020, 5:42 pm - $A: And I will share on how you can create that.
24/03/2020, 5:43 pm - $H: Thank you Ma'am
24/03/2020, 7:22 pm - $E: Can i take TOEFL test on Socrative? It is feasible
24/03/2020, 7:23 pm - $A: If you think it can work out on that platform you can do that.
24/03/2020, 7:24 pm - $E: Sure.
24/03/2020, 7:28 pm - $C: Are the senior students in your section informed of the posts made on slate if you've shared it with the section?
24/03/2020, 7:28 pm - $C: Two of my senior students failed to report on the tasks
24/03/2020, 7:29 pm - $C: Thank you so much. That will be immensely helpful.
24/03/2020, 7:30 pm - $A: Usually how do they get information?
24/03/2020, 7:33 pm - $C: I have been posting on slate and whatsapp. Both are on google classroom and one is on whatsapp definitely
24/03/2020, 7:35 pm - $A: Then they don't have the excuse  as you are posting on multiple  platforms for students benifit.
25/03/2020, 11:03 am - $B: Ma'am, one of the students asked me that are they going to have separate final projects for lab and class? Or is it going to be lab project only?
25/03/2020, 11:03 am - $A: Separate final projects for lab and class
25/03/2020, 11:04 am - $B: Okay thanks
25/03/2020, 2:55 pm - $G: @92***** thankyou for sharing the guidelines on resources.

Just wanted to give my feedback to everyone, please when making resources don't forget to select your groups for access feature, so they are visible only to your labs.
25/03/2020, 3:10 pm - $F: I accidentally made a folder, but removed it and made a new for my sections only. 

Sorry, if any of you got that email.
25/03/2020, 3:19 pm - $A: You are welcome. I hope it was clear and helpful.
25/03/2020, 6:58 pm - $C: I have a query @92***** . Are we uploading our attendance records on flex online as well or just keeping it on paper for now?
25/03/2020, 7:05 pm - $D: I guess, she did mention that these online labs would be considered as normal labs. So, we would be marking the attendance on flex. @92***** is it like that?
25/03/2020, 7:09 pm - $A: As the CS department has a schedule up, this means attendance will be uploaded by us.

For students who had issues about not joining the session, they can talk to the HOD and Academics about it.
25/03/2020, 7:09 pm - $A: Let me confirm again from Dr $S3P1's email
25/03/2020, 7:09 pm - $A: Yes this is the case
25/03/2020, 7:09 pm - $C: Great, thank you Ms. $A.
25/03/2020, 7:10 pm - $C: Sure.
25/03/2020, 7:14 pm - $E: 
25/03/2020, 7:14 pm - $E: 
25/03/2020, 7:14 pm - $E: 
25/03/2020, 7:19 pm - $A: That's good to know Ms @92****
If possible can you also share how the quiz interface looks there
25/03/2020, 7:19 pm - $D: @92***** can we have another platform as well for these online classes apart from WhatsApp?
25/03/2020, 7:21 pm - $C: 
25/03/2020, 7:22 pm - $B: Can we use Google classroom?
25/03/2020, 7:22 pm - $D: My students have also asked me to use google classroom.
25/03/2020, 7:22 pm - $A: What do you have in mind ?
25/03/2020, 7:22 pm - $A: Yes!
25/03/2020, 7:23 pm - $A: I indicated that as a possible platform in my email
25/03/2020, 7:23 pm - $C: I've been using that for announcements and everything just the worksheets I asked them to submit using email with their feedback as well.
25/03/2020, 7:23 pm - $D: Maam, my students think google classroom is better. But, do we need an official account for it or we can use our Gmail account as well.
25/03/2020, 7:24 pm - $B: The only problem is with the compilation of assignments and tasks.
25/03/2020, 7:24 pm - $D: Yes.
25/03/2020, 7:24 pm - $E: No no.
25/03/2020, 7:24 pm - $A: You can make a Google classroom from your own gamil account.
25/03/2020, 7:25 pm - $C: I'm using my personal gmail and it seems to be fine so far. I just didn't use submissions options as I thought that functionality is available on paid versions..
25/03/2020, 7:25 pm - $E: I can share as an example. I didn't add answers in the software so it may have a different interface. I will try to share both: one with answers and the other one without it
25/03/2020, 7:26 pm - $D: Alright, Maam. Then I will be watching a few YouTube tutorials for understanding google classroom. And will use this platform from the next week 
25/03/2020, 7:26 pm - $D: Ohhh
25/03/2020, 7:26 pm - $A: No it's available on free versions too
25/03/2020, 7:26 pm - $D: üëçüèº
25/03/2020, 7:26 pm - $A: That's how I did it and learned the different aspects of the platform
25/03/2020, 7:27 pm - $C: Great. I'm using that with my next lab then, .
25/03/2020, 7:27 pm - $A: That would be great!

I am testing Google Forms out. Will provide feedback to you all on how it goes
25/03/2020, 7:27 pm - $D: üëçüèº
25/03/2020, 7:29 pm - $G: I have used Google forms for my submissions.

Will give you feedback after class.

And on the other end I am waiting for Microsoft Meet account. In case that is sorted by next week. Will use it. Since it is officiall.

Or else will create Google Classroom depending on the activities.
25/03/2020, 7:30 pm - $D: Yeah, I was waiting for that as well.
25/03/2020, 7:31 pm - $A: This is what I wanted to assess and it looks like the universities will not open on 5th given the situation. 

So I wanted to test the platform and it's different aspects out before suggesting you all to follow that or develop materials in that
25/03/2020, 7:31 pm - $C: So did I today in a more efficient way thanks to a discussion with @92**** and I'll give you feedback after my lab tomorrow
25/03/2020, 7:32 pm - $C: Though all my students finally transitioned to the g classroom space completely, so am I.
25/03/2020, 7:35 pm - $A: That's good to know! The more we explore and test platforms the more we can assess it's possiblities.

@92**** Microsoft Teams is a promising platform.
25/03/2020, 7:35 pm - $E: 
25/03/2020, 7:36 pm - $G: I have used Google Classroom in my previous job. A paid version of it.

We had over 50 students. Hence it were official accounts so students had their names as IDs (it was easy to identify)

Secondly you can post assignment. Give deadlines. If someone doesn't submit, you would know. If someone submits after deadline. You get to know as they appear as late submissions.

You can give online feedback on submissions and an email gets sent out to students as comments.

After you are done checking or even mentioning grades on it.

You can return the assignments back to students.

It is kind of an amazing tool.

I haven't used a free version. Will check around to see how much liberty a free version offers.
25/03/2020, 7:36 pm - $E: That's the one without answer key
25/03/2020, 7:38 pm - $A: Nice!  

Was a separate file for the audio provided or it was embedded in the quiz?
25/03/2020, 7:39 pm - $E: 
25/03/2020, 7:39 pm - $E: That's with answer key
25/03/2020, 7:40 pm - $E: 
25/03/2020, 7:40 pm - $E: That's how it looks like when you add answers to it
25/03/2020, 7:40 pm - $A: I haven't used Google Classroom in Fast. I used that in another university but I used the free version.

I like the different functions and online submission aspects. Saves a lot of paper
25/03/2020, 7:40 pm - $E: 
25/03/2020, 7:41 pm - $A: Looks promising
25/03/2020, 7:42 pm - $E: 
25/03/2020, 7:42 pm - $E: The results can be generated in the form of excel sheet. The pdfs of students answers can be sent back to them via email
25/03/2020, 7:42 pm - $G: Hey $E.

I didn't give these options. Because I was wondering about the answer for Q14.

What's the answer for Q14? Could you please tell.
25/03/2020, 7:43 pm - $E: They had to specify. Due to the limitations, they choosed more than one answer since it for Rag and Jazz, they were supposed to select multiple answers
25/03/2020, 7:44 pm - $G: Does socrative allow for students to select multiple options rather than just one?
25/03/2020, 7:44 pm - $A: 14 had three answers, more fill in the box or drop down box option would work in that
25/03/2020, 7:45 pm - $E: Yes. It even has options to give true/false or short que answers as well
25/03/2020, 7:45 pm - $G: Yes. Google form allows for multiple checks as well.
25/03/2020, 7:46 pm - $E: Yes description option is also there in it. I didn't want to confuse students so refrained from using it for now
25/03/2020, 7:46 pm - $G: Great. Thanks $E. I would also try this one in upcoming tasks.

Let's see how G forms work this week.
25/03/2020, 7:46 pm - $E: My pleasure ‚ú®
25/03/2020, 7:47 pm - $C: If this platform streamline the audio and submission of assessment then could be a viable option
25/03/2020, 7:48 pm - $C: Streamlines*
25/03/2020, 7:49 pm - $A: Google Classroom does. I took video submissions for another course I am taking
25/03/2020, 7:51 pm - $C: The part I liked today was that my students were able to comment on exactly the announcement they were referring to and I could clarify their doubts visible to all participants which helped immensely
25/03/2020, 7:51 pm - $C: So its very interactive like that
25/03/2020, 8:56 pm - $F: I have used Google forms too. Will share my feedback too.
26/03/2020, 3:26 pm - $F:  All.
I hope you all are well. 
I had my First online class on Zoom today (actually two classes from 8 30 to 2). I had Zoom session with both sections.  It was a very interactive session and students gave me really good feedback. They had a lot questions regarding the questionnaire, I explained it to them.
There was no voice distortion as my both classes were in the morning.  Also, I used audio, not video.  

The experience with Google documents was good too. They submitted the activities on time. 19 mins before the class timing, I uploaded both activities material on Google classroom, and after instructions students did their work. Like for 36 minutes audio, I gave them 40 mins. For the next task I gave them 20 mins. Few students did it real quick as they already studied the material last night. 

They said, the session was interactive and they prefer Zoom for future classes too. For Google Documents, they said it saved their time and they didn't face any difficulty. However, few students said TOEFL is tough.
26/03/2020, 3:28 pm - $F: Amazingly, all students joined the Zoom session and were there throughout the session. I  asked students some questions to see whether they were listening or not, and they were.
26/03/2020, 3:28 pm - $C: So did I today. I'll give my feedback today in the evening as well.
26/03/2020, 3:29 pm - $F: The written feedback is yet to come. 
I have a lab tomorrow, so after that I will give an overall feedback.
26/03/2020, 3:30 pm - $F: Thank you Ms. $A for your guidance and timely responses.
26/03/2020, 3:42 pm - $A: That's good to know! All of us have tested different platforms this week to see what would work out.
26/03/2020, 3:44 pm - $G: Hey $A. Yes you are right. Exploring these platforms is an amazing learning experience. And each day is a new addition.
26/03/2020, 3:45 pm - $F: Yes, the best part is we are learning so much.
26/03/2020, 3:46 pm - $G: I had to ask you. What should I do with students who have submitted one task but not the other.

There are 3 students in total from both sections who did listening activity but not worksheet.

What should I do with their attendance?
26/03/2020, 3:48 pm - $C: And each class was a different experience for me due to different platforms. I'll share at the closing of the week which limitations I encountered in each.
26/03/2020, 3:49 pm - $F: One student from H2 didn't show up. I asked the CR to text him and he replied, I am ill. I have the reports too. So I just said if CS academics know this, I have no issue. 
Is it so, or do I need to communicate sth else?
26/03/2020, 3:50 pm - $C: I have this query too. One student's case in first lab
26/03/2020, 3:54 pm - $A: This is a bit tricky. Let me see.
26/03/2020, 3:54 pm - $D: üíØüíØüíØ
26/03/2020, 3:55 pm - $A: You are rights the academics with deal with it in case of any issue of attendance on the students part
26/03/2020, 3:55 pm - $A: No you do not need to communicate anything else.

You have post a message and ate on the platform.now it's the student's task to be there
26/03/2020, 3:56 pm - $A: Ok. I will generate a feedback email for a report so you can discuss that there too
26/03/2020, 3:57 pm - $B: I told my students I will mark you late, if you are not going to do all the worksheets.
26/03/2020, 3:57 pm - $C: Perfect!
26/03/2020, 3:58 pm - $B: Worked for me.
26/03/2020, 3:58 pm - $D: Same üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
26/03/2020, 3:58 pm - $D: Because we are giving them enough time.
26/03/2020, 3:58 pm - $C: Also, can we encourage the students if they want to pick a survey topic not necessarily concerning their university or student experience but one that is workable?
26/03/2020, 3:59 pm - $B: I let them chose topics outside university.
26/03/2020, 3:59 pm - $B: Cuz one wanted to do a survey on  March.
26/03/2020, 4:17 pm - $C: Interesting. One of mine has designed a brilliant survey on corona virus measures!
26/03/2020, 5:01 pm - $A: They can go ahead with any topic
