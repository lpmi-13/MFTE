@johncutlefish Strategy should outlive specific initiatives and experiments. It’s easy to conflate the two.

@mentorafrika Although you shared it publicly, I realize I made a joke using your tweet about something that was upsetting you. I didn’t mean to make light of that situation and hope everyone worked/works out ok.

@johncutlefish I’ve never seen a tool change culture on its own. The organization - with leadership encouragement and participation - changes the culture, and the tool facilitates the new way of working, collaborating, and communicating.


We’re potty training this weekend. Observations, lessons, and stories 🧵


24 hours in, and I’ve only had one accident.


Choose your meals deliberately. Now is not the time for spicy dishes or laxatives.


A few friends asked about timing. My son is 26 months old, and our motivation was preschool, cost of diapers, and demonstrated interest in bodily functions. He seemed ready, so we followed his queues.


@johncutlefish Do you relate this to the innovators dilemma?


@Prof_Vitriol The depends budget was getting out of hand


We’re taking the naked, stay at home, vigilantly watch approach. It’s going to be a long weekend. We decided to rip the bandaid (diaper) off.


Little dude has a cold so we’re watching for liquids from all ends.

My favorite part of this experience is watching my wife run around the house chasing our son as she tries to look into his butt to determine if he’s starting to poop.


We’ve had 3 meltdowns so far. 

Well my son has had one. The other two were my wife.


@UndiscoveredDev Thank you! 🤗


Just walked around the block. First time out of the house since Thursday. Apparently the world has continued turning while we’ve been hunkered down talking about potties.

Sure NPS surveys are fine, but having customers referred by other customers is the true indication of satisfaction and love.

I am constantly blown away by how many @tackleio customers are repeat buyers at a new company or referred by others in the industry.

Just spent $100 on home covid tests at Walgreens where they were being rationed to 4 per person. They restock on Tuesdays and ran out one person after us at 10:30am on a Wednesday.

I’m privileged financially and schedule wise. How are we caring for those less fortunate?

“Chill is a miserable attitude when it comes to hosting gatherings.” @priyaparker in The Art of Gathering

Why hosting with compassion and order is important 🧵


“It isn’t enough just to set a purpose, direction, and ground rules. All these things require enforcement. And if you don’t enforce them, others will step in and enforce their own purposes, directions, and ground rules.”


If you don’t use your authority as host to structure and guide the gathering, others will. And even with the best intentions, they will do so from their perspective.


Be a generous authority. Be deliberate about the purpose of your gathering and work hard to ensure each guest can have that experience.


“Find the courage to be authoritative in the service of three goals: (1) Protect your guests (2) Equalize your guests (3) Connect your guests”


In attending your gathering, guests have accepted your authority organize, deliver, and enforce an experience with purpose. They’re counting on you. Don’t be chill.


@mootpointer Highly recommend the book! Super relevant to communities.

Can’t tell if my toddler is lying about washing his hands because he wants the snack or if he truly believes he already washed them. https://t.co/NVmtqhCenv


@johncutlefish Discovery starts with a persona or market opportunity, research focuses on problems, and multiple solutions are evaluated. 

Often, projects start with a solution, discover the problem, and hope for a market opportunity.


@clairevo I’m pretty sure we’ve tested the same cold twice cause it’s making the rounds through my family. This isn’t fun.


New game: keep your heart rate as low as possible while watching a two year old run through the house with a bowl of pee.

We need to wash everything.


@ttorres Wow, this is so conscientious, considerate, and compassionate. I’m sorry it’s a scenario you need to navigate.


@johncutlefish Lagging indicator that mostly correlates to mean age of family members. Strong relationship to CSAT.


@johncutlefish @tackleio You kinda teed this up by asking about problems to *tackle*


For the first time in 2+ years, everyone in my family pooped in a toilet today.


But keeping it real… Peeing is going well. He didn’t like pooping though. Despite encouragement and support, he didn’t want to sit on the potty. The approach seemed to scare him, and it was tough on us to kind of force him.


He danced around and clearly had to go but was trying not to. Finally he had no choice, and as he let loose, I lifted him onto the potty. He cried. This isn’t easy.


But once he was done and clean, he was so proud! Like super stoked that he had done it.


Parenting is excruciatingly hard, but when you have a moment of connection with your child or see them learn something new, when they are proud or satisfied or happy, it is the best thing in the world. Teaching your offspring to be successful is existentially satisfying.

But because life isn’t all cute, here’s more…

He’s been screaming for almost an hour straight. Didn’t want to take off his pull up, didn’t want yogurt, wanted yogurt, didnt want yogurt in the yellow bowl, wanted a granola bar, didn’t want it whole, didn’t want it broken. https://t.co/tZtM8eqNOc

@rufflisa That’s exactly the same with us! Movie, cold, and soup. Hope you feel better and enjoy the movie!


@clairevo I followed you for PM stuff but consistently relate to the parenting stuff.

We made the brilliant decision to potty train this week (while also fighting a family wide cold) and and have been cooped up inside with a toddler and his fluids.
