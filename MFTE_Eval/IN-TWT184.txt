@aakashmehrotra Yes, they should round off. I mean, less than 50 will be reported as 0, 50-100 as 50% of actual numbers and so on. That way kids who aren't going to school for 2 years can actually watch news and practice maths at the same time.


@rohini_sgh Because "gang rapes happen all the time".


@ElliottBlackwe3 @ophelia11111 This reminds me of my mother rocking me gently on her thigh and reading out  (Bengali rhymes for children) to me while I sucked my thumb and listened to her with rapt attention.


@meenakandasamy Why you be so gorgeous? *Girlcrushing so hard*


@FunnyNaani You have a long way to go. You are the wittiest person I have come across in a long, long time. Witty and savage. Across age groups.


@darab_farooqui @banojyotsna @FahadZirarAhmad My day is made!


Bangles,  , begging or loving, #NewIndia denies a #Muslim their very existence. How do they live with Rabindranath encouraging all Hindus and Muslims to tie  on each other's wrist in solidarity or  Subhash trusting his aide Abid Hasan with his life? #HindutvaTerror https://t.co/i4Su5Y1iNS


@FunnyNaani Sadly, iPhones are never going to be my phone. Poor.


@babumoshoy @somadexterous Strawberry overrated  Maharashtra-er interior-ey fresh strawberry  overweight British heroine without corset type-er  .


@ophelia11111 The  tell on your  looks heavenly.


@huesonmycanvas So sweet! Come with her for sometime  if you can? I would love to catch up with you and feed you.


@KashifKakvi @hussainhaidry @DGP_MP @SPNEEMUCH @vinodkapri @abhisar_sharma @zoo_bear @TribalArmy @Profdilipmandal How barbaric! What has this country come down to? @narendramodi alone, despite his dark mind, can't create this ecosystem where one's hatred thrives on another. How have we so willingly been a part of his master plan?


@ophelia11111 So cute!


@AunindyoC I love your threads! So regular yet savage!


1/2 I forgot what a joy it is to wake up early and make myself a leisurely breakfast. Not fancy. Strong black coffee and varieties of omelette (mushroom/sausage/cheese/cherry tomatoes/red and yellow peppers/  ) or a fried egg with toasted bread. #breakfast


1/2 Now that the topic of eggie in a basket came up, it's a beautiful morning to reflect on how a yolk carefully dropped in the middle of a piece of toasted and buttered bread with a hole in the centre always reminded me of #VforVendetta .


2/2 If I'm feeling particularly adventurous, maybe an egg roll/egg bhurji/Dim-pauruTi/pancake/eggie in the basket. Made myself an unhurried breakfast after 5 years. And so nostalgic for early 2015 days in Bombay! All I need now is a good ol' newspaper(not digital)now. #breakfast


@Joydas @ImAbhishek7_ He won hearts already. A much much bigger person than the likes of Sachin Tendulkar.


@whosthatmiss Welcome to the club! Glad you got rid of the overhyped 30. Enjoy the occasional grey hair, weekends at home and get used to being taken seriously. Days of being patronised by men are truly over.


@adilhossain @swatiatrest  betrayed feel . . How dare you deflower me and not marry me. eTa how dare you make me go on a date with you and then not protect the offspring of the date type I suppose.


@TopKnotAndKeys @PRAVESHPARAS One of life's unexpected pleasures is also asking for a book, the shopkeeper replying that it's out of stock and recommending something else that you read for the next 15 minutes and finally decide to buy because you like it so much!


@chhuti_is  a pregnant woman travelling to another part of the city for her favourite sandwich was also news.


@TheBoltiAurat Beyond me. But I know what it says about the rapist. He has the right surname and says his prayer to the right Gods.


@Agrimonious Also, If the woman's name was Afreen Hossain, it probably won't have made it to the news.


@ofnosurnamefame @chhuti_is I had been an absolute fan of Amul's sharp wit and close watch of current affairs till now. TILL NOW.


Why, in the least, did she not find a male protector to stop her from leaving home at night and accompany her if she needed to step out for a medical emergency? #WomenSafety #womenempowerment https://t.co/ZH51Xhm9om


Is it only me or there are others who use onion-garlic when they are cooking but dread eating them in someone else's cooking? That explains why  are mostly what I eat when I come home.  as Bengalis would say. High on fish though. 


@adilhossain And I also miss small things about them when I'm not at home that I find annoying in general. Watching TV, criticising life choices of other people, making food more important than it actually is, freaking out everytime I'm supposed to go out.


Also, I wanted to call it my pet peeve but #Google tells me it requires the person in question to find something annoying. And one look at me and people would know I'm not capable of finding any food annoying. #foodie


@Agrimonious Absolutely with you on this! Have seen almost all my exes consider my not giving consent either a turn on which encourages them to overpower me and take me by force or a mood killer because how can I not consent to getting fucked by a man once I have accepted them as my partner?


@Soma_G  was obviously one. And whenever someone else answered the landline and I feared it would be a boyfriend asking for me. And guardian call by teachers in school.





@KaunAurat Arranged marriages are scary. What if he finds my farting disagreeable? Or my burping un-ladylike?


@Adiba__8 They will break apart and mould themselves into something very different from what we have been taught to believe, I suppose. Or cease to exist altogether.


#Afghanisthan is burning. There's absolute disregard for human lives. And we sit here, watching through a TV screen, tensing up at the latest twist and turn in our latest political thriller. #KabulAiport


2/2 #VforVendetta was my introduction to politics in art, the oppressed resorting to anarchy to reclaim what was rightfully theirs. And eggie in a basket, though very unfamiliar to my part of the world, still symbolises dream of a better life by the have nots to me.


Now that #Amul has been MODI-fied, @paperboatdrinks have become my go-to brand for campaigns and artworks that make me nostalgic.


@DConquered Don't know about English but growing up in a non-Hindi household, my Hindi is poor enough to be influenced by the others and their accent. An unconscious effort to fit in too. In #NewIndia , proficiency in Hindi is how one's patriotism is measured. Among other things of course.


@j_garima_j More power to you! When the brightest young minds are jailed under false charges, cultural revolution is the only hope we have to reclaim our democracy.


@swatiatrest @sumit_mehdi 
Truly, the impact real education can have should scare these bigots. They aren't paranoid at all. Mahashweta Devi, Bama, Sukirtharani and Manto do have the power to cause what these guys fear.


In states up north, a female child is considered so worthless that it's killed before or shortly after birth. And my parents offer me  today before it's offered to their God. 


@ophelia11111 I also had  for dinner!


Of course a light and sound show where one of history's darkest massacres had happened. Because they are "celebrating" it, you fools! #jalianwalabagh


Curiously,quite a few of the structures the Supreme Leader have been closely associated with are phallic shaped. The top of the #CentralVistaProject and now the "newly renovated" #jalianwalabagh . For a married celibate, isn't he a little too obsessed with the male genital organ?


With all due respect, I don't understand the hype around  . Or Lord Krishna at large. In a society that propagates the virtues of monogamy and lists out taking multiple wives as a vice of  , how has an adulterer and rapist become a God?


@rjVACHAS No. Very few HRs do. I have even had instances where I applied and the recruiter never replied, then sourced my profile from a job portal and called me. Maybe it's worse for some industries but common to all industries.


@deepigoyal @zomato This is a great step!


@quinoa_biryani Love yourself first.


@AarKiBolboBolo So in love with the  It's regal!


@Cryptic_Miind Can I consume both in, say, Delhi and then burp or shit in Mathura? Or that'd be criminal too?


@thegreatsanyal @mtanmay @hutomp Wow. I mean, wow.


@rohini_sgh And I wonder at times that it can't be only one man's doing. It was there all along. Nurtured carefully, covered to protect it from public at large, like homemade pickle, marinating only to become deadlier. The philosophy he stands for enables our mass violence. That's all.


@adilhossain This is a gem. I can't believe you have a LETTER he wrote to you!


Rest in your creation, Budhdhadeb Guha. My teenage would have been incomplete without . #BuddhadebGuha


I'm not a Hindu. My parents are.  was made at home every year. I remember now that we never made a batch after  but here's the magic of growing up in a pre-Modi India - it took me 31 years, specially 7 years under this communal RSS regime to realise this. https://t.co/gl9E8iK7gT


@NetflixIndia , I'm minimising usage of #AmazonPrime to ensure I don't have a role to play in @JeffBezos next space trip. Can you please get #ADeathInTheGunj , #soundofmetal and as much work of #SatyajitRay , #Rituparno and #AparnaSen on your platform as you can, please?


@Sritika_ You mean you don't, at other times? I crave  24x7. And it doesn't help that I took a vow years back to not have  anywhere outside West Bengal. To avoid disappointed bordering on depression, that is.  and mangoes. Strict no no outside West Bengal.


@Elizatweetz Love this!


@ObaidMahdi This is so heartbreaking.


What every #Fascist fears -
Women who speak their mind.
Education that talks about equal rights.
Music of resistance.
Hearty laughter.
Young minds who reason everything.
People owning their sexuality.
Love that refuses to cower.
Pictures from #Afghanistan confirm my belief.


@Sritika_ *disappointment


1/2 Fights with parents break my heart these days. We have so much to learn from each other! How I wish I could have spoken in a language they comprehend or they could have let go of the emotional high pitch they start at. #FamilyWoes #GenerationGap


2/2Fights with parents help me teach a thing or two about conversations between unequals.A teenager me denied them their right to spend time with their daughter because there wasn't much else in my power. Now their tear jerker reactions to my arguments are no different. #Musings


@adilhossain Thank you. But with your leadership skills, talking to mass at large (because that's probably where our parents belong these days) would probably be more successful. Because you would have more patience to carefully tread down that path. Or that's not how it works?


Tomatoes were going bad. So, mother bought  and  for a good ol' tomato  . I think she was trying to make an economical decision. Not sure if 'economical' is the word I would use while tallying monthly expenses. My tummy is happy though. 


@adilhossain I don't encourage torturing or killing any animal until and unless I'm very fond of eating them. But even I was very amused seeing her rather unconventional campaign for animal rights. Pandemic induced culture-  eshawb news hawbey- . Banana bread symptom  .


@adilhossain And no one prepares either parents or children for the highly complex relationship they are supposed to share for the rest of their lives.


@MrsDMaths I was made to. Apparently wearing pants all the time wasn't very ladylike. And running risk of a #MarilynMonroe moment wasn't acceptable for a girl from a respectable family either. So, I'm afraid I do agree with your daughter but in my days, how children felt didn't matter.


@j_garima_j Someone like me who's educated and more aware than many women in India allowed my family to let me believe for ten years that I should keep quiet if I'm molested in bus, train or autos because acknowledging it would only create problems for me. What hope do the rural women have?


@ronnysen This is right out of a painting. Beautiful.


It's extremely damaging to see an unhappy marriage closely as a child. When the mind is impressionable and one looks up to their parents as the ones who can never do anything wrong. In the end, such bitter relationships end up haunting every relationship the child will ever have. https://t.co/7mqqnJldcQ


@lraheelkhan I thought he had retired.


@j_garima_j Not only them, cloth dolls, hand embroidered tablecloths, my childhood paintings, ceramic ware, Mother's Day cards and so much more...


@adilhossain I feel as if it's entirely my fault to not be able to communicate successfully. Or that I come from a position of power these days due to whatever little financial responsibilities I have taken up. But abusing power to belittle anyone is the last thing I'd consciously want to do.


@yezaawa Hot chocolate. Sitting down and stretching my back against a wall with my eyes closed. Hugs or someone squeezing my hands too. These are things that help me. Not sure if they are medically approved.
