. You are being requested not to pay your bills through bkash payment on 31st of any month. They're not providing us the statement of that day which is creating more confusion. Those who wants to pay at bank they can continue. You can continue your payment from 1st September thought bkash and bank also. Please clear your pending bills.

8/31/21, 4:09 PM - $S1: 
8/31/21, 6:26 PM - $U2:  Ma'am. 
Ma'am, there was a mistake with my billing which I've already informed our hall president of. I didn't get any corrected bill yet so my bill is due. In this situation should I wait for the corrected bill or should I pay the actual due sum anyway?
8/31/21, 8:20 PM - $A: Did you give your any details? How could I understand from which hall you are,Ur subject,id..! This is how confusions are being created.
8/31/21, 8:24 PM - $U2: 
I'm sorry for not adding the informations before ma'am. Given there are quite a few students who had errors with their billings, my previous statement was rather generalized.
8/31/21, 8:26 PM - $A: What was the problem? And when you last paid your bills? Please mention the amount also
8/31/21, 8:29 PM - $U2: The problem :
My bill was only due for August and the bkash charge alloted for that amount. But the bill I was provided with showed my due was 5430.
Last payment : 31st July 2021.
8/31/21, 8:34 PM - $A: 
8/31/21, 8:35 PM - $U2: My due should have been 2250+bkash charge. Should I pay this amount tomorrow ma'am or do I wait for the corrected bill?
8/31/21, 8:35 PM - $A: Okay..No problem dear. I hope you have seen the previous post of mine. Last month those who have paid on 31st have had problems. And from now onwards you are requested not to pay on 31st of any month. So Insha Allah your problem will be solved. So you can pay the amount you counted.
