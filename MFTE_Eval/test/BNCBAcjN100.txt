Paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia with the t(7;12)(q36;p13) rearrangement: a review of the biological and clinical management aspects



The presence of chromosomal abnormalities is one of the most important criteria for leukaemia diagnosis and
management. Infant leukaemia is a rare disease that affects children in their first year of life. It has been estimated that
approximately one third of infants with acute myeloid leukaemia harbour the t(7;12)(q36;p13) rearrangement in their
leukaemic blasts. However, the WHO classification of acute myeloid leukaemia does not yet include the t(7;12) as a
separate entity among the different genetic subtypes, although the presence of this chromosomal abnormality has
been associated with an extremely poor clinical outcome. Currently, there is no consensus treatment for t(7;12)
leukaemia patients. However, with the inferior outcome with the standard induction therapy, stem cell
transplantation may offer a better chance for disease control. A better insight into the chromosome biology of
this entity might shed some light into the pathogenic mechanisms arising from this chromosomal translocation,
that at present are not fully understood. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of the molecular
and genetic basis of this disorder. This will hopefully open some grounds for possible tailored treatment for this
subset of very young patients with inferior disease outcome. This review aims at highlighting the cytogenetic
features that characterise the t(7;12) leukaemias for a better detection of the abnormality in the diagnostic
setting. We also review treatment and clinical outcome in the cases reported to date.

Introduction
Leukaemia is the most common type of cancer in childhood (Fig. 1). Among acute leukaemias, one in five is
represented by acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), whereas
four fifths are acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).
Cancer statistics from the National Registry of Childhood Tumours show a peak at age 2 - 3 years for the
insurgence of ALL, whereas AML is more common
within the first year of life and after age 10, with an incidence of 16 cases per million in the United Kingdom.
The incidence of AML decreases in children older than
2 years of age, but rises in adolescence when it stays stable

until adulthood, reaching its peak in older individuals [1].
Similar statistics have been encountered in the populations
of the United States [2, 3].
In the past three decades, there has been a considerable improvement in the cure of childhood leukaemia,
reaching a long term survival rate of more than 90 % in
ALL and approximately 70 % in AML [3, 4]. However,
certain categories of childhood leukaemia are still considered high risk, and this level of risk is dictated by the
presence of cytogenetic and molecular genetic markers.
The amended world health organization (WHO) leukaemia classification includes the most relevant chromosomal rearrangements to allow proper risk stratification
of leukaemia patients [5]. To date, the t(7;12)(q36;p13)
rearrangement found in infant AML has not been incorporated in the WHO classification, although it has been
le distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License
which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,
associated with poor clinical outcome [3, 6]. 

Fig. 1 Main types of childhood cancers. The ideogram shows the different proportions of cancers affecting paediatric patients. Acute leukaemia is
the most commonly reported cancer in children, with ALL affecting approximately 80 % of patients and AML diagnosed in 15 - 20 % of patients. Forms
of chronic leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes are very rare in children and their incidence has been omitted from this graph (based on cancers
statistics collected from the National Registry of Childhood Tumours, years 2009 - 2011, accessed through the Cancer Research UK website)


This cytogenetic entity has not been associated with a particular
morphologic or immunophenotypic subtype [6, 7], but
has been found in a range of AML types as well as a
case of myelodysplastic syndrome [8]. The scope of this
review is to give the reader a comprehensive understanding of the t(7;12) rearrangement at the chromosomal level and the available methods for the detection
of this cytogenetic marker for an improved diagnosis
and a better estimate of the real incidence of this type of
leukaemia. We also review the clinical outcome and the
therapeutic approaches that have been adopted in the
cases reported to date.
Review
The t(7;12) rearrangement: chromosomal appearance and
cytogenetic features
The t(7;12) rearrangement typically involves the long
arm of chromosome 7 at band q36 and the short arm of
chromosome 12 at band p13 (Fig. 2). These chromosomal regions reside towards the end of the chromosomes, near the telomeres and involve fragments of
similar sizes. The banding patterns of these subtelomeric regions are typically fairly homogeneous and not
distinctive of a specific chromosome. For these reasons
the t(7;12) rearrangement is a difficult cytogenetic entity
to detect microscopically, using conventional methods
of chromosome banding. Nevertheless, early reports
demonstrate identification of t(7;12) based on banding
analysis only [9 - 11]. Furthermore, the t(7;12) has been
found associated with deletions of the long arm of
chromosome 7, therefore the der(7) in these cases might
be misinterpreted as a del(7q). Fluorescence in situ hybridisation in one del(7)(q22) case, helped revising this
abnormality as a der(7)del(7)(q22q36)t(7;12)(q22;p13)
[7, 8, 12].
Translocation breakpoints
In the t(7;12)(q36;p13), the breakpoints on chromosome
12 are consistently at the 5′ end of ETV6, between exons
1 and 3, whereas the breakpoints on chromosome 7 are
quite heterogeneous affecting band q36 in regions
proximal to the Homeobox HB9 (HLXB9) gene [6, 12,
13], also known as MNX1 (motor neuron and pancreas
homeobox 1). There have been descriptions of breakpoints in 7q31 [10], 7q32 [14, 15], and 7q35 - 36 [8].
However, some of these findings were not validated
using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Informative FISH probes spanning 7q would have been helpful
towards achieving a more accurate definition of the
breakpoints in these cases.

Cryptic and complex rearrangements
To date, three cases of complex rearrangements harbouring the t(7;12) have been reported [16, 17]. These
three way translocations were characterised by FISH
and described as (i) t(5;7;12)(q31;q36;p13) [16]; (ii)
t(1;7;12)(q25;q36;p13) [16] and (iii) t(7;12;16)(q36;p13
;q12) [17] respectively. Due to the breakpoints affecting
the terminal regions of both chromosomes 7 and 12,
the t(7;12)(q36;p13) is considered a cryptic rearrangement. The use of appropriate FISH probes would surely
improve the detection of this abnormality and might
uncover a higher proportion of t(7;12) translocations
masked by more complex rearrangements, as in the cases
of the three way translocations previously described.

Additional abnormalities
Interestingly, the majority of t(7;12) cases have been
reported in association with specific aneusomies. A recent
review of the literature reported that only 2 out of 44 cases
harboured the t(7;12) as a sole abnormality [17]. In particular, the presence of one or more additional copies of
chromosomes 8, 19 and/or 22 have been recurrently
described [6, 7, 15].

Fig. 2 Schematic representation of the t(7;12)(q36;p13) and fusion transcript formation. a Representation of the 7q36 and 12p13 regions spanning 1
Mb around the genes of interests. The breakpoints are proximal to the HLXB9 gene on chromosome 7 and at the 5′ end of the ETV6 gene on
chromosome 12. HLXB9 is a small gene composed of three exons. ETV6 is a larger gene composed of eight exons. In both cases the direction
of transcription is from the telomeric to the centromeric end. b The gene location and direction of transcription of both HLXB9 and ETV6 are
shown on the ideograms of chromosomes 7 and 12. For each gene all the exons are indicated. c Derivative chromosomes 7 and 12: the
der(12) harbours the whole HLXB9 gene and the 3′ portion of ETV6 including exons 3 - 8. If a fusion transcript arose from this translocation,
splicing of HLXB9 exons 2 and 3 as well as any genomic material from chromosome 7 downstream to HLXB9 that was translocated on the
der(12) should take place


 The presence of these additional abnormalities has been reported in samples at diagnosis
and/or at relapse, indicating that the acquired aneusomies
might be sign of clonal evolution and important for the establishment and the survival of the leukaemic clone.

Molecular mechanisms
Is there a fusion gene?
A well - established driver of haematological malignancy
when a chromosomal translocation is present, is the
formation of an oncogenic fusion gene such as BCRABL resulting from the t(9;22)(q34; q11) in chronic myeloid leukaemia or ETV6 - RUNX1 in t(12;21)(p13;q22) positive ALL [18]. As a consequence of these gene fusions, a
fusion transcript is produced with subsequent generation
of a chimeric protein whose altered properties have an
impact on the onset of the disease. Reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT - PCR) to identify the fusion
transcript in t(7;12) patients showed a fusion of exon 1 of
the HLXB9 gene to either exons 2 or 3 of the ETV6 gene
resulting in two different HLXB9 - ETV6 fusion transcripts:
an out of frame longer variant (exon 1 of HLXB9 to exon

Tosi et al. Biomarker Research (2015) 3:21 Page 4 of 11
2 of ETV6) or an in - frame shorter variant (exon 1 of
HLXB9 to exon 3 of ETV6), both fusion transcripts
contain the first exon of the HLXB9 gene as well as the
ETS domain (DNA and protein binding domain) and
the pointed N terminal domain (PNT) (protein - protein
binding domain) of the ETV6 gene [6, 19 - 21]. However, the presence of an HLXB9 - ETV6 fusion transcript
has been shown only in approximately 50 - 60 % of
t(7;12) patients reported to date (Table 1), whereas the
reciprocal ETV6 - HLXB9 transcript has never been
observed. This is understandable when looking at the
details of the translocation breakpoints at the chromosomal/genomic level. Although the breakpoints on
chromosome 12 are well defined and disrupt the ETV6
gene in a precise location at its 5′ end, on chromosome
7 the breakpoints are scattered in different regions
proximal to the HLXB9 gene. This implies that the
whole HLXB9 gene is transferred onto the der(12), but
there is no disruption of the gene itself. Moreover, between HLXB9 and ETV6 on the der(12) there should be
genomic material of variable extent from 7q, depending
on the location of the 7q breakpoint (Fig. 2). This
means that an HLXB9 - ETV6 fusion transcript would be
generated due to some form of long range splicing.
Depending on how efficient this mechanism is, the
fusion transcript might fail to be present in all t(7;12)
patients. Importantly, there has been no report on the
presence of a HLXB9 - ETV6 protein to date, therefore
the production of a chimeric protein as an oncogenic
trigger for the t(7;12) leukaemias is debatable.
HLXB9 over - expression
As a fusion transcript is detected in only approximately
fifty per cent of t(7;12) AML patients, it is debatable that
the formation of the fusion gene is the only contributor to
leukaemogenesis in these cases. What all the t(7;12) leukaemias have in common is the over - expression of the

Notes: The majority of patients considered in this table were reported as having
the t(7;12) in the karyotype of their leukaemic cells. However, in 4 cases [13, 50,
56] the fusion transcript was described in patients with abnormalities of 7q and
or 12p, implying that the t(7;12) might have been present, but underestimated in
these cases
HLXB9 gene, suggesting that this, rather than the formation of a fusion gene, might be the driver of leukaemogenesis in these patients. Expression of other genes mapping
at 7q36 near the breakpoint has also been evaluated and
quantified in t(7;12) patients. However, this analysis
showed that expression of NOM1, LMBR1 and RNF32 in
7q36 as well as ETV6 on 12p13 was not different from
that observed in AML patients without the t(7;12) and in
normal bone marrow [6].
The expression of HLXB9 in healthy progenitor blood

cells in the bone marrow has been investigated by several groups. Early expression studies performed in 1991
showed that bone marrow enriched for CD34 - positive
cells highly expressed HLXB9, whereas unfractionated
bone marrow cells expressed HLXB9 in low levels, and
bone marrow cells depleted of CD34 - positive cells did
not show detectable levels of HLXB9 [22]. Later on, the
same authors reported increased levels of HLXB9 expression in acute leukaemias that were not seen in the
leukaemia patients at remission. These studies suggested
a link between HLXB9 over - expression and leukaemogenesis [23]. Other authors reported a relatively low
HLXB9 expression in normal bone marrow by real time
quantitative PCR (RT - Q - PCR) and did not observe
HLXB9 expression in healthy CD34 - positive bone marrow cells, but described increased levels in the bone
marrow of leukaemia patients with the t(7;12) rearrangement [6, 24]. Observations from our group and by
others confirmed elevated HLXB9 expression in t(7;12)
leukaemias as well as in some patients with acute myeloid leukaemia with chromosomal abnormalities other
than the t(7;12) [20, 25]. HLXB9 expression has been associated with hypo - methylation of its promoter in a
series of paediatric AMLs. However, in the same study it
was found that in childhood ALL the HLXB9 promoter
was hyper - methylated leading to down - regulation of this
gene. The authors suggest that HLXB9 might act as an
oncogene in AML, whereas it would act as a tumour
suppressor gene in ALL [26]. Over - expression of HLXB9
has been also reported in lymphoma [27, 28] and cancer
types other than haematological malignancies, such as
breast cancer [29], testicular cancer [30, 31] and hepatocarcinoma [32]. These studies support the idea that
HLXB9 involvement might be pivotal in other tumours
as well as leukaemia. Limited studies have been carried
out on the HLXB9 expression at the protein level, whose
presence has been demonstrated in bone marrow smear
of leukaemia patients with the t(7;12) by immunohistochemistry [16]. Further studies on leukaemia as well as
other cancer types are needed in order to clarify whether
the presence of elevated HLXB9 transcript corresponds
to proportionate levels of the corresponding protein, or
whether translation is regulated by RNA interference
pathways [31].


HLXB9 over - expression and genome organisation
An increasing number of studies currently focus on gene
expression in the context of the three dimensional (3D)
genome organisation in the interphase nucleus [33]. Gene
positioning within the different areas of the cell nucleus
has been associated with different levels of gene activity,
with the general assumption that transcriptionally active
genes are localised in the nuclear interior, whereas less active genes tend to be positioned towards the periphery of
the nucleus [34 - 37]. It has also been shown that gene positioning in the nucleus is not fixed, but may change according to different stages of development [38, 39] and in
pathologies [40]. It has been demonstrated that the
chromosome 3D structure within the interphase nucleus
has an influence on the transcriptional activities of specific

genes due to a position effect mechanism. For instance,
gene expression at a specific locus can be controlled in cis
by enhancer elements localised at a distance from it, via
formation of active chromatin hubs (ACH) [41 - 43]. Several studies have been conducted to observe the behaviour
of cancer loci in the interphase nuclei using different cellular models and some authors proposed that the altered
nuclear topography of genes could be used as diagnostic
tool in oncology [44, 45]. Studies on cancer fusion genes
have shown nuclear repositioning of chromosomes and
genes after a translocation event [46 - 48] and this repositioning has been shown to have an impact on expression
profiling [49]. We have observed the behaviour of 7q and
12p loci in the interphase nuclei of leukaemia cells carrying the t(7;12) in a number of patients and shown that the

(Fig. 3) [20]. What does this imply in terms of gene
transcription? We have shown the presence of HLXB9
transcripts in the same samples with the t(7;12) rearrangement by RT - PCR, however, we did not investigate the origin of the transcript. We assume that the nascent
transcript would originate from the der(12), due to the
juxtaposition of the HLXB9 gene to the downstream region of ETV6. This would facilitate new interactions between active cis elements and the HLXB9 promoter,
leading to the formation of active chromatin hubs and
repositioning of the chromatin in the cell nucleus. Alternatively, active trans sequences from different chromosomes could activate HLXB9 by a bridge formation
in the new nuclear environment.

Gene expression signature of t(7;12) leukaemias and HLXB9
targets
The first study to investigate expression profiling of
t(7;12) leukaemias was conducted by Wildenhain et al.
[50], who compared leukaemic blasts of patients positive
for the presence of the HLXB9/ETV6 fusion transcript
with those with MLL rearrangements. It has to be said
that these represent the two most common chromosomal rearrangements found in very young AML patients, including infants and mainly children younger
than 2 years of age. The authors found that genes
expressed in the MLL group of patients, were significantly down - regulated in the HLXB9/ETV6 positive
patients. These included HOX genes and genes characteristic for the MLL - induced transformation process
such as MEIS1, HOXA9 and C - MYB. On the other hand,
together with over - expression of HLXB9, the HLXB9/
ETV6 positive patients showed up - regulation of genes
implicated in cell - cell interactions and cell adhesion
such as EDIL3, CNTNAP5, ANGPT1, DSG2, ITGA9,
ITGAV, KDR and SIGLEC6. These are known to be implicated in the maintenance of quiescent haematopoietic
stem cells (HSC) and homeostasis of the HSC niche.
Overall, this study implies that the mechanisms of leukaemogenesis in these two types of childhood leukaemia
are fundamentally very different. Evidence would suggest
that the HLXB9/ETV6 positive leukaemias might be
initiated through an alterations of interactions between
the HSC and the HSC niche. Balgobind et al. [51] used
expression microarrays to examine a large cohort of
samples from paediatric patients with AML including
seven samples from patients with the t(7;12). The authors built a classifier based on 59 genes that enabled
them to identify very specific expression profiling signatures predictive of cytogenetic and molecular subtypes.
This classification tool, based on the genetic heterogeneity of paediatric AML, is of great diagnostic potential
although its feasibility and implementation in the
diagnostic setting will have to be further explored. The
significance and the impact of HLXB9 up - regulation in
the t(7;12) leukaemias merits further studies. These
would shed some light on the pathways triggered by this
chromosomal rearrangement. The only report to date to
explore possible targets for HB9 (the transcription factor
coded by the HLXB9 gene) in haematopoietic cells was
performed on the HL - 60 myeloid cell line using ChiPon - chip and expression profiling analyses [24]. This
study describes binding of HB9 to the prostaglandin E
receptor 2 (PGTER2) promoter resulting in downregulation of PGTER2 and consequent reduction of intracellular cAMP level. This down - regulatory effect on
PGTER2 expression was also observed in t(7;12) patients.
Together with repression of PGTER2, Wildenhain et al.
[24], found that HLXB9 expression in the HL60 cell line
had mostly a down - regulatory effect on other genes,
particularly ZYX and ETS1. Physiologically, expression of
PGTER2 modulates differentiation of osteoclasts. Upregulation of PTGER2 has been shown in immature
myeloid precursors. PTGER2 becomes subsequently
down - regulated after the cells have differentiated into
osteoclasts [52]. Further work is needed to clarify the
implications of PTGER2 down - regulation on the bone
marrow niche and on the differentiation of immature
pre - leukaemic cells.

Diagnostic tools
Chromosome banding
The t(7;12)(q36;p13) rearrangement affects the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes 7 and 12 respectively. Due
to the small size of the genomic fragments translocated,
this rearrangement is difficult to detect using the conventional methods of chromosome banding.

Fluorescence in situ hybridisation
Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) has been fundamental for the identification of the t(7;12) as a nonrandom rearrangement [7]. Initially, probes covering the
entire ETV6 gene in conjunction with 7q36 probes have
been used for the screening of a relatively large number
of paediatric patients. This screening enabled us to estimate the incidence of this translocation of approximately
one third of patients with infant leukaemia [7]. It has to
be noted that the breakpoints on 7q36 in the t(7;12) patients were found to be heterogeneous and generally
proximal to HLXB9 without disrupting the gene itself
[12]. A three colour FISH assay with probes flanking the
HLXB9 gene was developed specifically for the detection
of the t(7;12) (q36;p13) (Fig. 4). This assay enabled us to
successfully identify cryptic and more complex t(7;12)
rearrangements [17]. Commercially available FISH
probes for the detection of the t(12;21) translocation are
also suitable for the detection of the t(7;12), where a
split ETV6 signal is found on the der(7) and on the
der(12).

Fig. 4 Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) performed on metaphase chromosomes harbouring the t(7;12)(q36;p13). a FISH using a three
colour approach enables the detection of both normal chromosomes 7 (harbouring only blue hybridisation signals) and 12 (harbouring green
and orange fluorescent signals) and their derivatives (green signals on the der(7) and blue and orange signals on the der(12)). The DAPI
counterstaining of the chromosomes has been converted into grey scale to simulate a G - banding pattern (figure taken from Naiel et al., 2013
[17]). b Schematic representation showing localisation and colour - code of the FISH probes relative to the three colour probe set used. c FISH
using a two colour approach enables the detection of both normal chromosomes 7 (harbouring only orange hybridisation signals) and 12 (harbouring
only green fluorescent signals) and their derivatives carrying orange and green fusion signals. d Schematic representation showing localisation and
colour - code of the FISH probes relative to the two colour probe set used. It should be noted that the two colour set does not allow to discriminate
between the two derivatives based on colour pattern only. The size and morphology of chromosomes 7 and 12 compared to their respective
derivatives are very similar, making the identification of the rearrangement difficult without the aid of FISH. Both probe sets have been provided by
MetaSystems Gmbh, Altlussheim, Germany


 Dual colour whole or partial chromosome
painting may also reveal the t(7;12)(q36;p13). However,
visualisation of the rearrangement on one or both derivatives might be impaired due to the small size of the
translocated fragments.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
Specific primers have been designed for the detection of
the HLXB9/ETV6 fusion at the cDNA level by reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT - PCR) [21].
However, the presence of a fusion transcript by RT - PCR
has been identified only in approximately 50 % of t(7,12)
leukaemia patients (Table 1). For this reason RT - PCR
does not represent a reliable method for the detection of
the t(7;12) rearrangements at diagnosis. However, in those
patients positive for the HLXB9/ETV6 fusion transcript,
RT - PCR would prove useful for the monitoring of minimal residual disease [53].

Expression profiling
Studies based on expression microarrays have shown that
the leukaemic cells of patients carrying the t(7;12) have a
distinctive expression pattern that allows to discriminate

this specific cytogenetic subgroup from other [51]. Microarray based technologies combined with appropriate classifiers constitute potentially a very powerful diagnostic
approach, although in a routine diagnostic laboratory the
availability of specialised equipment and costs involved
might impact on the choice of method.

Incidence
A literature search has shown that at least 47 leukaemia
patients with the t(7;12) have been reported to date,
based on the presence of the chromosomal translocation and/or the fusion transcript [17]. To date, there
are a very limited number of studies to address the incidence of this translocation, with a quite comprehensive investigation considering a total of 345 paediatric
patients [6]. In this study, patients were subdivided in
289 ALL, of which 99 were infants, and 59 AML, of
which 18 were infants. It emerged that 5 out of 18
infant AMLs (age 0 - 12 months) harboured the t(7;12)
rearrangement, making the incidence of this rearrangement near one third of infant AML. In addition to the
above, the t(7;12) was also found in one infant with
ALL and one 18 month old child with AML. A previous
study was conducted on a more selected series of leukaemia patients, chosen on the basis of age <20 months
and the presence of additional copies of chromosomes
8 and/or 19, as well as abnormalities of 7q and/or 12p
[7]. This study showed that 10 out of 23 patients harboured a translocation between 7q and 12p. However,
in only 7 cases ETV6 was involved in the translocation
and of these, 6 cases had breakpoint in 7q36 and one in
7q22. Later studies confirmed that the incidence of
t(7;12)(q36;p13) was low when considering AML paediatric patients enrolled for clinical trials. These studies
reported four t(7;12) cases out of 729 enrolled in the
UK MRC AML10 and AML 12; one case out of 454 in
AML - BFM 98 and 8 cases out of 981 enrolled in the
COG trial AAML0531 [54 - 56].

Prognostic significance and treatment options
Prognostic significance and clinical outcome
Cytogenetic and molecular markers are important
factors to be taken in consideration when stratifying
patients into high risk/low risk categories and are of
guidance for making treatment choices. The WHO
system for the classification of myeloid neoplasms and
acute leukemia has been amended to include such
information [5]. At present, the t(7;12)(q36;p13) is not
included in the WHO classification, although it is recommended that it be considered as a separate entity
when assessing infant leukaemia [3]. Review of published data on the clinical outcome of the t(7;12) AMLs
reveals inferior outcome with 3 years probabilities of
event free survival (EFS) of 0 - 14 % and overall survival
(OS) of 0 - 28 % (Table 2) [6, 13, 14, 16, 56]. However,
one report of a paediatric patient with acute megakaryocytic leukaemia and t(7;12) described achievement of
complete remission with chemotherapy alone for
60 months at time of publication [19]. Papers from
different clinical trial groups such as the Children's
Oncology Group (COG) [56], UK MRC AML 10 and
12 [53] and the Berlin - Frankfurt - Munich (BFM) [55]
included the t(7;12)(q36;p13) in the group of patients
with 12p abnormalities and confirmed their association
with poor prognosis. It was also stressed the need to

consider these patients as a high risk group based on
the cytogenetic classification of AML.
Standard treatment
Standard treatment for paediatric patients with AML includes induction chemotherapy (remission induction) with
an anthracycline based regimen which also contains cytarabine. The choice of the anthracycline drug used, as well
as the total doses of chemotherapy differ between different
centres and collaborative study groups. Most children
achieve complete remission with rates of 80 - 90 % after 2
induction courses and the toxic death rate is in the region
of 5 %, with the failures being due to resistant disease [4].
Consolidation or Intensification chemotherapy (post - remission therapy) is essential for cure. It includes the administration of high dose cytarabine possibly in
combination with other drugs. Doses, duration, number of
drugs as well as scheduling differ between collaborative
groups. Currently, treatment related death rates in AML
paediatric patients, with the improvement of supportive
care and the administration of treatment in experienced
units, are now less than 10 % [4].
Stem cell transplantation
Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered an effective therapy for treatment of high risk
leukaemia. However, the high toxicity which includes a
mortality rate reaching up to 20 % in some series, makes
it not a standard therapy in the first line treatment of
AML patients with favourable cytogenetics, where a high
cure rate is achieved with chemotherapy alone. For
patients with unfavourable cytogenetics, although the
benefit of HSCT is still to be fully explored, HSCT is considered by many groups as the standard of care [57, 58].
When patients relapse, the most important prognostic
factors that will determine the outcome of the salvage
therapy are the length of first remission and cytogenetics.
In the United Kingdom, HSCT is generally used as
consolidation therapy as part of salvage treatment with a
survival rate of around 40 % achieved irrespective of the
source of stem cells. However, it is important to better
understand molecular markers and cytogenetics of the
disease to identify patients who would most likely benefit
from this modality of treatment [59]. To date, although
there are no published guidelines about the management
of this group, there is increasing interest among paediatric
haematologists/study groups to consider intensification of
therapy with allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first
complete remission [13, 15, 16, 56]. Further study of this
important subgroup of infant AML as well as the incorporation of t(7;12) in future risk stratification schemas are
needed to better understand the best treatment approach.
Conclusions
The t(7;12)(q36;p13) is a rare cytogenetic abnormality in
paediatric AML and difficult to identify using conventional
karyotyping. The use of FISH with appropriate probe sets
would enable diagnostic laboratories to identify this cytogenetic entity confidently and to give a better estimate of
its occurrence. The incidence of t(7;12) leukaemias is low
in overall paediatric AML, but significant in infant leukaemia. There are no published management guidelines for
those patients, but it is now acknowledged as a high risk
group with poor prognosis and accordingly many are being
treated with HSCT in first complete remission. Better understanding of the genetic mechanisms at the basis of
t(7;12) leukaemias and the role of HLXB9 in the establishment of this malignancies would provide grounds for possible tailored therapy.
