@FatimaTujJoho10 Which place is it on campus? BTW, nice click.


The good thing is that the administration is now looking into it and a huge number of dormitories are under construction. #JU #Savar


Since the foundation of #JahangirnagarUniversity, it's been named as the only university in #Bangladesh which could provide 100% residency to its students. But for the last 10 years, it has been deviating from its historic tag. https://t.co/0r0i4hgrj6


@NewAgeBDcom The conditions are even worse at the rural level. From my experience, I can ensure that; by strengthening only the Union administration, these conditions could be eradicated from the very root level. That's why we need nothing but willingness. 😒 #Bangladesh #Yaba #DRUGS


@munwarenj When did it happen, brother?


@NurulHaqueNur2 Good initiative. But recommendations for your party will be to go to the farthest corners of the country to strengthen the party from the very root level. Indeed, as the capital of the country, Dhaka needs higher attention but,that wouldn't be wise to treat it like the only unit.


@SwedenAmbBD @charlottaschly @friselljohan Madam ambassador we appreciate your country's efforts in building our polytechnic sector from the very beginning.

@MrsAlbitar @YounesArar2 For this at first,  must be united. It's good news that 🇮🇷 and 🇸🇦 are working to get over their disputes. Let's see what happens.


People watching a #cricket match by standing hours outside a tv shop at #Mirpur 11. Nothing else matters for them, they just want their boy @Sah75official doing great in the match. That's why my country 🇧🇩 is marked as a cricket-crazy nation. Best of luck, boy.#IPL2O21 #KKRvsRCB https://t.co/XRX4BSeDvt


@SwissAmbBD Madam Ambassador, I'd suggest you visit #Sazek, #Sylhet and #CoxsBazaar. These are like the most scenic ones; otherwise, you'll repent for not visiting them.


@Dhaka_Air What're the healthy air ranges?


@m_najirul Where is it? Nice click.


@SwedenAmbBD Have you been to Sazek? If haven't, then I would say you should be. The curves of the mountains ⛰️ will mesmerise you. #Sazek #Rangamati


In Bangladesh 🇧🇩 #COVID19 condition is getting nastier in the last few days. If we couldn't deal with it now, we have to pay for it. #Bangladesh #Dhaka

@dr_opatel @PDBeurope What're their (Cu, Zn) roles in proteins structure?


@SwedenAmbBD How's the weather there, ma'am?


@SelmaGuennoun Is #Algeria going to produce vaccines just for its own people or planning to export them?


@patel_javed @tphb1989 I would say you should visit Nizum Dip too. Though it's in the jurisdiction of #Noakhali district, you can go there by taking the route of Swandip, #Chittagong. #Bangladesh


@Mohammadfahim68 Unfortunately, we Muslims are going too far than the true meaning of these words. Quran and  are the only foundations that could help us to overcome all these challenges. May Allah  have mercy upon us. .


@KoumIshrak What about the recent power shift in your country? Were they according to public demands or just imposed by the foreign interest holders?


@VanessaBeeley @gailymalone What about the grave accusations against him by thousands of his citizens who are in exile?


@KoumIshrak Yeah, but we were so hopeful that at last something good is happening in Arab and it could change the whole scenario. Unfortunately, we couldn't make it last longer.


@Twentyo52159919 Yup, totally agree with you.


@POTUS Your statements are unexpected. Please try to address the situations from an unbiased stand. #FreePalestine

@RashidaTlaib @POTUS I'm shocked by seeing the usual one-sided reaction from the U.S. For God's sake, please stop this hypocrisy.

#indianeedoxygen, so the world should come forward to help this nation. It's high time to prove that humanity matters the most. And as a neighboring country #Bangladesh should address the situations asap, and take necessary steps accordingly.

@AsmaIslam34 I think the education system should pay more attention to the practical way of learning. We're just memorising words. Even after finishing the degree 🎓  we don't need them at all. The syllabus for any government job is so mundane. #Bangladesh


@CDCDirector You should speak much before. As a scientific mind, you should make statements with precise references.


When all the doors get shuttered it's only His door left open to hear the scream and prayer. So pray 🙏 hard and be the navigator of your own destiny. 🕋🕌

When rain and thunderstorms confront in our countryside, this is how it looks like. My District Noakhali is now in total lockdown due to #CoronaPandemic. In our mainland 🇧🇩, our stakeholders who are making policies on this battle are really in an obscure condition I guess... https://t.co/ODesBuorwr


And now this report from Cambridge fascinating me. This fastest PCR test also can be done in a BSL-2 lab rather than BSL-3, which is also a positive one especially for countries like  🇧🇩. Let's continue our prayer for the betterment of mankind. Report on the Oxford vaccine. 👇


The positive news is approaching with time. And I am hopeful that the current unprecedented situation won't stay longer. Previously an Oxford Professor mentioned that she was about 80% positive that she could make vaccines within September...

@htTweets If they did it through RT-PCR then the chance of error should be the lowest than any other available testing.


@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump U say it right. Thank u for such bold reply.


@realDonaldTrump But Mr President u have no right to tell openly about which drugs gonna save people and which drugs don't. Let the brightest people of the field tell it. Thank you.

@AbeirLiton Is it famous Musapur beach of our south side region?


From my experience, I can tell u that, in rural areas of #Bangladesh 🇧🇩 people aren't conscious about #CoronavirusOutbreak. So, people like teachers, leaders, university students, government officers should play important roles to make people conscious in their respective areas.
