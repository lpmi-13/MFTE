The Number Of Muslims Is Rapidly Increasing In Japan
From 110,000 to 230,000 Muslim worshippers seems like embracing Islam is becoming a new norm in the East-Asian country, Japan.
As per the data revealed by Tanada Hirofumi of Waseda University, the number of Muslims in Japan is significantly increasing. From the past ten years, the number is more than double. In 2010, the statistics show the number of Muslim worshippers in Japan to be 110,000. But at the end of 2019, it is increased to 230,000 (including as many as 50,000 Japanese converts).
Moreover, the country in order to facilitate Muslims during their prayers consists of more than 110 mosques.
Muhammad Tahir Abbas Khan, a professor at APU and head of the Beppu Muslim Association (BMA) told, the increased number of mosques is a welcome move for the Muslims from around the world by BMA.
In the year 2001, when Mr. Khan was relocated to Japan he was a Pakistani graduate. He told that there were only 24 mosques in the country and not a single one in Kyushu.
Tokyo Camii, Okachimachi Mosque, Otsuka Mosque, Nagoya Mosque, and Dar al Arqam Masjid are not only some of the most popular and the most important mosques as well.

EFU Life Assurance Ltd has released its latest three-part web series titled as #Humrahi. Through this web series, the company has aimed to uniquely position insurance policies as a behavioural change which is an absolute necessity for the Pakistani society.
Interestingly, the company has tapped into the millennial mindset and is now encouraging them to consider taking up insurance policies as a medium of savings.
For instance, in this particular series, a young couple is planning on buying an insurance plan to fulfill the dreams they have for their children as well as for themselves.
What do you think about this latest campaign by EFU? Do let us know in the comments section below!





ARTICLE: When you are in a crisis what you do is build an infrastructure-you build a pyramid if you have to, build anything. You create jobs and the economy doesn't stop--John Maynard Keynes
But when you have multiple options, you need not build pyramids; instead you should select the most appropriate option that would take care of the most of our jobless, that too at the most economical cost and at same time having the widest and the deepest positive impact on the national economy.
Prime Minister Imran Khan's first preference seems to be housing. On the face of it, the choice seems to be just what, as they say, the doctor had ordered. There is, indeed, a huge backlog of housing in the country. It is a highly labor intensive activity as well, catering mostly to most of the daily wagers which make up the majority of those who live from moment to moment. And a vigorous house building activity has a multiple economic impact with forward and backward linkages triggering accelerated production in some 70 or so related manufacturing facilities.
However, so far the housing industry in the country has remained confined to constructing luxury houses and apartments, for example the DHAs, Bahrias and similar other housing schemes which when completed require, to make them livable, substantial water, gas and electricity supplies which are already in short supply in our country. Such schemes have done nothing to reduce the backlog of housing that cater to the needs of our middle and lower middle classes. In fact most of the real estate actors in the country have only catered to those whose main purpose for investing in housing has been to camouflage their ill-gotten money. And, as the amount of black economy started swelling and the available land for constructing such luxury houses became dearer these real estate actors started buying agricultural land for the purpose, thus impacting negatively on our future food security situation.
One cannot, therefore, rule out the possibility that the generous concessions being offered to the housing industry by the government would not be manipulated by these real estate sharks to enrich their pockets further without making any dent in the affordable housing backlog the country is suffering from currently.
What is perhaps needed to avert these pitfalls is to change the focus of construction industry from housing to infrastructure building. And to save precious resources from going waste a ban should be immediately imposed on launching luxury housing schemes and on converting agricultural land into plots for housing. In any case investment in such luxury housing schemes is considered dead investment - as good or as bad as investing in building pyramids.
PM's Naya Pakistan Housing scheme, however, should be taken in hand in right earnest as such schemes have the potential to curtail significantly, in due course of time, the huge backlog of the kind of houses that are required to bring housing within the reach of our middle and lower midde income groups. Verticle buildings having two-room bankable apartments should be built in all cities in the public sector and allotted on mortgage basis. Private sector should be kept out of such projects.
The recently announced Quaid-i-Azam Business Park occupies the top of a long list of infrastructure projects that are being earmarked for early launch. Indeed, the Sheikhupura project is ideally located between the business hubs of Lahore and Faisalabad. Such projects would increasingly attract relocation of those manufacturing units in China that have become uneconomical for Beijing because of escalating labor costs there. Other such projects include Ravi River Front urban development.
A number of such projects to be constructed in Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa costing a total of Rs. 290 billion have already been approved by the ECNEC. The list includes 306 km long Hyderabad-Sukkur Motor-way at a cost of Rs165.67bn; 47.55 km Khyber Pass Economic Corridor project at a cost of Rs77.9bn; 146 km Hoshab-Awaran-Khuzdar Section of M-8 project worth Rs26bn; Land acquisition for Swat Motorway Phase-II at a cost of Rs20bn.
All these projects could be launched as public-private ventures which would cause accelerated economic activity in the immediate surrounding areas. With job opportunities opening up at these locations as the projects get launched the labour force belonging to these areas gone to cities in search of livlihood would return home thus bringing down pressure on jobs in cities which in turn would cause a disruption in the labor supply-demand equation in cities resulting in the cost of labour going up in these cities which would certainly be a labour-positive development.
It would certainly be a prudent decision to let consruction industry take the lead in reviving the economy with special emphasis on infrastructure building. However, putting all your eggs in one basket would not be considered prudent. We need to take a closer look at other options as well, which may not seem as promising as the option of building infrastructure, but could be promising enough to merit a closer look.
And since we enjoy a clear comparative advantage in agriculture, this sector would in any case merit a closer look. More so because, this option concerns the future of our food security. And it is also highly labor intensive sector. And increased economic activity in the agri-sector would mean more job opportunties in the rural region which, to a large extent, would help discourage the exodus of able bodied population from rural to urban region. This will further lessen the pressure of population in cities which at the moment are bursting at the seams.
The focus on agriculture should be aimed at turning Pakistan into the granary and orchard of the entire region including the Middle East and Central Asia. The emphasis in the industrial sector should also be on agro-based manfacturing rather than engineering industry for which we lack comparative advantage.
The prospects for agriculture mainly hinge on adequate water availability, better seeds, use of modern technologies and the latest hardware. But first of all the government would need to take a number of steps on priority basis to improve the efficiency of water use. There is an urgent need to expand the program of linning of existing canals and building of small reserviors and dams.
In this regard the government would do well to seriously consider a recent statement of KP chief minister Mahmood Khan which he made during a Nepra hearing. Khan said that the province had a potential capacity of producing more than 30,000 megawatts of electricity, which could be utilized to address energy crisis in the country as well as solve KP's irrigation water problem.
There is also the need for increasing the use of drip irrigation by offering subsidy on the purchase of required equipment. Meanwhile, water charges need to be rationalized to make its availability cost effective. Also, cropping pattern, especially in Kharif needs to be changed towards less-water intensive crops. Sugarcane consumes three times as much water per acre as other crops like cotton which is the mainstay both as raw material for our manufacturing sector and also as major export earner.
Agricultural pricing policy also is in the urgent need of change. The coverage needs to include cotton (phutti), potato, onion and many other major and minor crops.
India has procurement/ support prices for as many as 28 commodities. Further, agriculture is massively subsidized in India. The total subsidy given to agriculture is as much as $27 billion. Fertlizer subsidy alone adds up to $13 billion. The corresponding estimate for Pakistan is about $600 million only. The price of urea in India is 60% less in dollar terms than in Pakistan.
We also need to set up silos for grain storage and cold storages for preserving perishable crops.
Also, we need to take a closer look at the livestock sector as well. So far we do not seem to have exploited this sector to its maximum potential. Of course, estimates show that the poultry products have shown fastest growth of almost 8% per annum. Milk consumption has also gone up by 2.5%.
However, there are no annual surveys of livestock and their output, as is done in the case of crops. We need to undertake such surveys regularly to update the real situation and make the most of this sector.

Having vanished completely earlier, the coronavirus has made a comeback of late with a second wave, initiating all sorts of panic, from nano micro mini smart lockdowns to reconsidering the opening of schools.
Wrong. None of it happened. Corona never went away. There is no second wave.
The coronavirus never really ‚Äúvanished‚Äù as was the perception last month. It was just that the positively rate had dropped considerably and very sharply ‚Äì and testing was down ‚Äì which led to substantially lower number of daily cases. Then came higher testing, which went up by a third over the previous 30-day period. The positivity rate, meanwhile, continued to be under 2 percent.
Now because the virus never really went away, you can‚Äôt expect zero cases every day. Case in point is Germany, which is often cited as a success story by the World Health Organization (WHO). Now Germany has seen a considerable rise in daily cases ‚Äì almost trebled in a month. This is in line with the rise in cases in most of Europe which certainly is witnessing a second wave. But Germany‚Äôs positivity rate continues to be flat since it flattened ‚Äì which only indicates there has been more testing ‚Äì and not necessarily a second wave.
Similar is the case with Pakistan. Pakistan‚Äôs testing suddenly went up in September. The number of cases on a daily basis started to look taller. But the positivity rate has remained flat at under 2 percent for over six weeks now, which is a remarkable feat and indication enough that the spread is well under control. There have bene nine consecutive weeks and counting of the positivity rate under 3 percent, which is considered the critical level to determine whether the outbreak is under control.
This is not to say there can‚Äôt possibly be a second wave in Pakistan. But it can be said with some degree of confidence that a second wave looks highly improbable. Studies dating back to July have shown the seropositivity rate at 36 percent, which in all likelihood is expected to rise significantly by now (see: Has Pakistan acquired herd immunity? published Sep 25, 2020). There is no need to panic, and the government is seemingly doing it right by ensuring the guard is not lowered.
Pressure will not change our ties with China, says PM Imran

Ramiz Raja advises Pakistan to work on fielding in order to win World Cup
Pakistan kept their run at the ongoing ICC World Cup alive, after they beat South Africa at the historic Lords on Sunday by 49 runs.
However, it was not all smooth sailing for the Men in Green as despite being fantastic with both bat and ball, the side remained poor in the fielding department dropping a number of easy and half chances. The fielding is one aspect of the game, which needs to be improved immediately if Pakistan wants to continue their run at World Cup said ex-captain Ramiz Raja.
‚ÄúPakistan needs to improve their fielding, because it cannot happen that bowlers dismiss batsmen twice, we are not grabbing even simple catching chances. No matter how brilliant a side is with the bat and ball, if you are not a good fielding side then you cannot win the World Cup. So this is a wake up call for Pakistan,‚Äù said Raja.
The cricketer-turned-commentator said that Sarfaraz and his men would need to be at their toes, against their upcoming match against the New Zealand, a side which has yet to face defeat in the tournament. ‚ÄúPakistan would need to tweak up their plans a bit against New Zealand,‚Äù he said.
With confidence regain, Pakistan is scheduled to face World Cup‚Äôs leading performer New Zealand in their next fixture on June 26.
